Helps you with composite score calculation , composite score cutoffs and your status of that call based on your overall profile which you enter.\\n2. Fast, easy to use and doesn\'t requires any login, email, response sheet link, application no or phone no. Doesn\'t stores any data of yours as it doesn\'t has any database attached.\\n3. Following colleges are covered - IIM BLACKI MBA, IIM L ABM, IIM L SM, IIM K Fin, IIM K LSM, FMS, IIFT IB, IIFT BA, IIT B, IIT D(MBA and MBA telecom), IIM Mumbai(All 3 programs), IISc, CAP\\n\\nPlease share this predictor with your friends and do upvote this post.

Doing a 30 min AMA on questions/ profile eval for interested applicants.

The last 125-150 students don\'t place well. It seems like there is a stagnation at high paying jobs in the country and the expansion at old IIMs will also increase competition for those seats. As such, ISB needed to expand the pool and it makes sense to expand it with slightly younger talent which will have lower placement expectations as well. Also helps them to pull apart the PGP and improve all the data points there for them to rank better globally. In future, I expect them to increase the PGP YL intake and reduce the PGP intake.\\n\\nWhat should you expect this year?\\n\\nThere is a reason that they are keeping the intake low this year which is to set the bar. The ideal candidate will be someone who barely missed ABCFMS because I dont know of too many people who would leave these 4 institutes to join ISB. The low intake also means that they can keep a high threshold and that will be a signal for quality for future. They will also work hard to place the students because of the same reason. They have also mentioned scholarships, though I feel these will be limited. I think ISB has had >> expected response and they won\'t need to give too much scholarship to get in the best students. \\n\\nShould you apply?\\n\\nShort answer is yes esp if you are above 98%ile. My sense is the cutoff will be 98%ile ish for the program. First year will see disproportionate focus and better ROI.

And no, I was never a Sharmaji ka beta. \\n\\nHere\u2019s how I aced XAT:\\n1. DM is the make or break section. Read the scenarios, put yourself into the shoes of the CEO of a company and make decisions. Do not optimise for society/individual, optimise for the business *ethically*. For example, if firing a team improves 10% profit immediately vs. changing machinery for the same improvement in 10 months, there\u2019s no harm in going for the first if your business does not have the required runway. \\n2. XAT QA and VARC are at par or a notch below the CAT level usually. If it\u2019s at par, accuracy is king. If it\u2019s a notch below, it becomes an accuracy + attempts game. \\n3. XAT has poems as RC. Do practise a few of them as many of them use old English and are unfamilar for most of the aspirants out there. \\n4. Read up on GK. It is not useful in the shortlisting phase, but if you end up getting a call at 95/96 percentile, a good GK percentile may help your case later. \\n5. XLRI is purely merit-based. A general male has a decent shot at BM with 97+ and HRM with 95+. For females, you can reduce 1/2 percentile points. (Based on the trend in 2023, might have changed in the last year so correct me if I am wrong). \\n\\nLastly, don\u2019t carry the weight of CAT to XAT. If you have nailed it, remember it\u2019s a new day. If you haven\u2019t, even then remember the same. When a batsman comes to crease overnight, he has to settle down and concentrate all over again. Treat this as the same. \\n\\nPrep hard and all the very best for XAT 2025!","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1h120h6/xat_preparation_pointers/","datetime":"2024-11-27 16:46:47 IST","votes":211,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Wisdom ",""],"archived":false},{"title":"Dump","author":"thegoddamnbatman74","url":"https://reddit.com/r/Indiangirlsontinder/comments/1gq3ujm/dump/","subreddit":"Indiangirlsontinder","body":"Also thinking of doing a tips/FAQ post.

It\'s a life which you\'ll be living after like 7-8 months from now. Don\'t think about that time and fuckup your prep. The next 20 days (approx) are more imp. Also, I\'ll be coming up with some motivating stories too in my next post! Prepare well and all the best \ud83e\ude75\u2728\\n\\nSo, rn I\'m sitting free after coming from an outing with my friends. And after a lot of discussion with a lot of peers and self analysing.. I\'ll share a few things with you all that you must keep in mind when you\'ll go into a b-school! \\n\\nBE READY TO GET JUDGED! Tum kuch karo. Mat karo. There are people who will judge you. I\'m a kind of a person who acts like a friend with everyone on campus. Because I have that \u092e\u093e\u0938\u0942\u092e\u093f\u092f\u0924 to consider everyone to be \\"a good and honest human\\" in the start. But. Even if you are nice and talk to everyone.. there is some other the other thing that will make someone or the other hate/judge you. You might say something in sarcasm but, then people will judge you on that because they won\'t get it ig. \\n\\nRUMOURS! This is like a cancer tbh. You are walking with a girl/guy on campus? Get ready to be paired with him/her. You are doing a case comp with someone? Yeah try kar raha hai/rahi hai. And then some or the other rumours about you! Luckily this didn\'t happen with me.. but happened to my friends (yaa fir mere baareme jo rumour hai mujh tak aaya hi nahi? \ud83d\ude02) \\n\\nThere are people on my campus doing glocal (idk how many of you know about this), and I don\'t really judge them cauz it\'s their life... Jo karna hai kare, then people who are into casual stuff etc. Everything is okay until and unless it\'s mutual. But, jo character assassination hoga fir tumhara! Wow \ud83d\ude02 Everyone is very much into tea and gossips (even I like to listen to them. But but... Never been a part of those groups who start spreading it or talking shit about random people). \\n\\nAnd there are many of my close female friends here who tell me stuff. And one thing that they tell me is... Girls might talk in front of boys in a good way and pretend to be a good friend.. but the same girls will sit in groups and bitch about that particular guy at the very next moment. Same applies to the guys but it\'s very very less as compared to the girls. \\n\\nBe calculative in what you are saying and where you are saying. You might be innocent enough to say stuff or share your feelings but people will take it in a wrong way (this has happened to me btw). \\n\\nMake a good set of friends. And btw. Pre SIP and Post SIP you\'ll have a different set of friends most probably (this didn\'t happen with me but with many of the people on my campus). And.. things will get sorted on this front.. but, just to protect your image keep those things which I have shared above in your mind! \\n\\nThese 4-5 months on campus has taught me a lot of things and it\'s interesting also lol. But again, if you don\'t care about the world and you have that idgaf wala attitude.. you are good to go.. but... At some point or the other things will affect you!

Maybe when I\'m 70, I\'ll look back and think, \\"What if?\\" But here\'s the thing: regret is a part of life, whether you have kids or not. Everyone deals with regret in some form, whether it\'s about missed opportunities, bad decisions, or, yes, not having kids. Parents regret things too, whether it\'s how they raised their children, the sacrifices they made, or the fact that their kid didn\'t turn out to be the next Einstein they were hoping for. Life is filled with moments of disappointment and longing, no matter which path you choose.\\n\\nAnd you know what? If the day ever comes where the regret hits me hard, I\'ll cry my heart out for two hours straight, then move on. I\'ve cried before over worse things than not having kids. I\'ll survive. What I won\'t do is bring a child into this world just to avoid the possibility of future regret. I\'m more than capable of dealing with my own emotions. I don\'t need a kid to do that for me - I\'ve got ice cream and Netflix for that, thanks.\\n\\n2. \\"You Won\'t Have Any Meaning in Life\\"\\n\\nThis one always cracks me up because it\'s probably the most selfish reason to have kids. So, what you\'re telling me is that you had a child to find meaning in your life? Wow, that\'s a lot of pressure to put on someone who didn\'t ask to be born. Let me get this straight: you brought a human into this world because you were searching for purpose? Isn\'t it your job to figure that out for yourself? Instead, you\'re expecting your kid to fill that void for you, to give you direction, to make your life feel whole.\\n\\nLet\'s be real. If you\'re relying on someone else, especially your child, to bring meaning to your life, maybe the issue isn\'t that I\'m missing out. Maybe it\'s that you haven\'t found your own path yet. I pity people who think they need a kid to feel fulfilled. You\'re just setting yourself up for disappointment because no one, not even your child can give you the meaning you\'re missing. That has to come from within. Maybe try a hobby first before creating a whole new human?\\n\\n3.\\"You\'ll End Up Lonely and Sad\\"\\n\\nAh, the classic \\"you\'ll die alone in a dark room\\" argument. It\'s funny how people automatically link old age with loneliness if you don\'t have kids. First of all, having children doesn\'t guarantee that you\'ll be surrounded by family when you\'re older. There are plenty of elderly people with children who never visit or call. So let\'s stop pretending that having kids is a surefire way to avoid loneliness. It\'s not a retirement plan, folks.\\n\\nAs for me, I\'m perfectly capable of making and maintaining deep, meaningful connections with people who aren\'t my biological offspring.  I have my partner, Friends and I\'m building a life filled with love and companionship. I\'m planning to become a plant mom soon, and I\'m sure my future monstera will thrive under my care. And above all, I love my solitude. I enjoy my own company. I\'d much rather spend my last days reflecting on the great memories I\'ve made with my friends and loved ones and my plants than being caught up in family drama or worrying about whether my kids will take care of me. Spoiler alert: my furry kids will be right there, and plants don\'t argue.\\n\\n4. \\"You\'ll Get Bored\\"\\n\\nBored? Seriously? There aren\'t enough hours in the day to do everything I want to do. I\'ve got a whole list of things I want to try, experience, and learn. Gardening and composting? Right there is the meaning of my life that you people asked for. I could spend weeks binge-watching all the classic shows I missed or learning new skills like creating my own eco-friendly cleaning products.\\n\\nI would learn to sew, take up painting, maybe even take violin lessons. Dancing? Sure, I want to give it a shot! The possibilities are endless. So, the idea that I\'ll be bored without kids? Nah. I\'m more worried about how I\'ll find the time to do everything I want. And if all else fails, there\'s always Netflix and my art studio dreams. My life is filled with things I\'m passionate about, and honestly, I couldn\'t be happier pursuing those without the constant worry of kids needing my attention. When was the last time you had a quiet moment to pursue your passions between diaper changes and homework help?\\n\\n5. \\"Without Kids, You\'ll Never Know What Love Is\\"\\n\\nSo now we\'re measuring love? Really? love isn\'t a competition. I don\'t need to win the \\"Most Intense Love\\" award by procreating. Let\'s not act like love is only valid if it\'s for a child. Love isn\'t some exclusive club that only parents get to experience. I\'ve been lucky enough to feel a kind of love that\'s beyond words, and that\'s more than enough for me.\\n\\nI don\'t need a child to know what love is. I cherish the relationships I have, and the love I\'ve felt and shared is all the more special because it\'s not tied to any expectation or obligation. Let me celebrate those connections because they\'re more than enough to fill my heart.\\n\\n6. \\"You\'re Too Selfish Not to Have Kids\\"\\n\\nOh boy, the \\"selfish\\" argument. Let me laugh for a second here. So, I\'m selfish for choosing not to bring a child into the world, but you\'re selfless for having one because you wanted to? Every reason people give for having kids usually comes back to them: \\"I wanted a family,\\" \\"I want someone to take care of me when I\'m old,\\" \\"I wanted to experience the joy of parenthood.\\" Who\'s the selfish one here? You had a child because you wanted to, not because the child asked to be born.\\n\\nYou gave the gift of life to someone who didn\'t ask for it. You\'re the one who wanted to live out this \\"beautiful\\" rat race and brought them along for the ride. So let\'s stop pretending that procreating is some grand selfless act. At the end of the day, every reason to have a child circles back to YOU. And that\'s fine; just don\'t try to frame it like I\'m the selfish one for opting out. I\'m just honest about my choices.\\n\\n7. \\"Society Needs Children to Continue\\"\\n\\nWe\'re at 8 billion people and counting. I think we\'ll be just fine without my contribution to the gene pool. There\'s no shortage of humans on this planet. In fact, we\'re struggling to manage the population we already have, with issues like climate change, resource depletion, and overpopulation. Maybe the solution isn\'t adding more people to the mix. Let\'s focus on fixing what\'s already broken before we start worrying about how many more people we can bring into this mess.\\n\\n8. \\"Let Your Kid Struggle... That\'s Life\\"\\n\\nWhy the obsession with teaching kids to learn through struggle? Have you all forgotten those nights when you were on the brink ,when it felt like the weight of the world was too much to bear and you nearly gaveup on life? You seriously want your kid to experience that, hoping they\u2019ll emerge like some battle-hardened warrior? What are we crafting here, a Naruto episode? Who\'s even cheering for that?\\n\\nIt\'s funny how you only romanticize life on your good days, acting like struggle is some rite of passage. Did you wipe those dreadful nights from your memory? You think every single human has the mental fortitude to fight through? And what happens to the ones who can\u2019t? Oh right, we just call them cowards.\\n\\nWhat war are you preparing your kids for? And why does it even have to be a war? Who convinced you that life\u2019s a battlefield? All most of us wanted was a simple, fulfilling human experience, not a training camp for emotional gladiators.\\n\\n9. Pathetic Sacrifices for Kids happiness\\n\\nIt\u2019s honestly tragic to watch parents race through life, exhausting themselves just to meet their kids\' every need and whim, constantly hovering like bodyguards. Sure, it\u2019s noble, but let\u2019s be real for a second: if your kids had the choice, they\u2019d probably prefer a parent who\u2019s happy and alive with passion, rather than one who\u2019s slowly fading into a shell of their former self. Romanticizing this \\"sacrifice everything for your children\\" routine is doing no one any favors. Children don\u2019t thrive because their parents gave up everything for them\u2014they thrive when their parents are fulfilled, living with excitement, and showing them what it means to truly enjoy life.\\nToo many parents forget what it feels like to really live. They abandon their dreams, their hobbies, even their intimacy, and transform into 24/7 service providers. And honestly, when was the last time they looked in the mirror and actually recognized the person staring back? Between shuttling kids around, sleepless nights, and endless obligations, they\u2019ve swapped their personal identity for a never-ending to-do list. And for what? So their kids can see a worn-out, resentful version of someone who used to have a fire? No thanks.

But here I am, with more money than I ever imagined, and it feels like my life is falling apart.\\n\\nA few months ago, I bought a lottery ticket on a whim. I almost forgot about it until I saw the numbers on the news. I couldn\'t believe my eyes\u2014I had won $600,000. At first, I was in shock. I called my boyfriend, J, and he rushed over, equally ecstatic. We were both over the moon, dreaming of what we could do with the money.\\n\\nBut the dream quickly turned into a nightmare.\\n\\nIt started with J. He began making plans for the money without really consulting me. He wanted to quit his job immediately, buy a luxury car, and invest in risky ventures. When I suggested we take things slow and maybe talk to a financial advisor, he got defensive. He accused me of not trusting him and said I was trying to control everything.\\n\\nThen my family got involved. My parents, who I\u2019ve always had a strained relationship with, suddenly wanted to reconnect. They started dropping hints about their financial struggles and how they could use some help. My sister, who\u2019s always been jealous of me, outright demanded a share, saying she deserved it for all the times she \u201csupported\u201d me. It felt like they were all looking at me differently, like I was just a bank to them now.\\n\\nJ became more distant and started spending a lot of time with his friends. He\u2019d come home late, smelling of alcohol, and we\u2019d argue about his spending habits and his new friends who seemed to only care about our money. The final straw came when he suggested we invest a large sum into a business venture his friend was starting. I said no, wanting to be cautious, and he exploded. He accused me of being selfish and not believing in him. The argument was so intense that he stormed out and didn\u2019t come back for days.\\n\\nDuring that time, my family\u2019s demands became more aggressive. My parents hinted that they were entitled to the money because they raised me. My sister called me greedy and accused me of abandoning my family. I felt trapped and overwhelmed, unable to make anyone happy.\\n\\nWhen J finally returned, we had a long, painful conversation. I realized that our relationship had become toxic, revolving around money rather than love and mutual respect. We decided to break up. He moved out, taking some money with him as a parting gift, and I felt a mix of relief and sadness.\\n\\nNow, I\'m alone with my fortune, but I\u2019ve never felt poorer. My family is barely speaking to me, and I\u2019ve lost someone I thought I\u2019d spend my life with. I\u2019ve hired a financial advisor and a therapist to help me navigate this new reality, but the emotional toll is immense.\\n\\nWinning the lottery was supposed to be a blessing, but it turned into a curse. I wish I could go back to the way things were before, when life was simpler and relationships were genuine. I just needed to get this off my chest.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fttqwr/i_won_the_lottery_and_it_ruined_my_relationship/","datetime":"2024-10-01 22:56:37 IST","votes":6839,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"Aaj Maine Jaana, CBSE Got Caught Increasing their Students\' Marks just to Compete with \'other\' Boards.","author":"FedMates","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AajMaineJana/comments/1fi0uzc/aaj_maine_jaana_cbse_got_caught_increasing_their/","subreddit":"AajMaineJana","body":"","media":"https://v.redd.it/oi04icg5a5pd1","datetime":"2024-09-16 15:39:03 IST","votes":62,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"What free things online should everyone take  advantage of?","author":"Creepy_Intention837","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fddksb/what_free_things_online_should_everyone_take/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fddksb/what_free_things_online_should_everyone_take/","datetime":"2024-09-10 14:46:17 IST","votes":30104,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"BIL slapped my hand and I chose not to attend his daughters birthday","author":"starky89","url":"https://reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fa3q06/bil_slapped_my_hand_and_i_chose_not_to_attend_his/","subreddit":"TrueOffMyChest","body":"Background: about a month ago, my husband (40m) and I (35f) were at my in laws for a large family get together. We had family from out of town visiting and it was going well. \\n\\nAt one point my brother in law asked me to take pictures of all the kids so we gathered them onto the couch and were arranging them to take the photo. Once we had them set up, I grabbed my phone and went to stand in the middle to get the shot, when I noticed my other brother in law (my husbands\u2019 sisters husband and niece in headings dad) was standing right in the middle of where I needed to be to get the photo. I had both my hands on my phone and not thinking too much of it, I nudged him to move with my elbow. I did not push him, just nudged him. I was so focused on getting the photo with all the kids being so little and knew I only had moments to get any decent photo. Anyways, as soon as I did that, he slapped my hand with the phone in my hand causing the phone to drop and began yelling at me saying not to push him. \\n\\nAfter that, he went and sat down, I was so shaken up because this had never happened and I was at a loss for words. I took a few photos and then couldn\u2019t and went to go approach him to clear things up. I sat down and asked him what the hell that was all about and he began calling me a rude person and that my behaviour was so bad and as things escalated he said your lucky I didn\u2019t punch you. \\n\\nI did not take lightly to this and remembered a year ago when he jokingly slapped my thighs while I was sitting down pretending to (spank me on my thighs) and another time when he pinched my back while we hugged to say hello at another family event. Those times I did not approach him directly because I\u2019ve had so many poor experiences with men victim blaming me for bad behavior and also that he\u2019s family and it put me in such an awkward situation. So at that time I did talk to my SIL about it, told her I didn\u2019t want to make anything awkward but just wanted him to stop touching me like that. She defended him saying he jokes around like that with his sisters and you shouldn\u2019t take it any other way. \\n\\nFor reference, him and his wife have always had marital problems including physical abuse towards themselves and they spank their kids. He is very vulgar and I\u2019ve called him out on a few occasions for being so mean to his kids (one time asked his daughter if she was an animal because only animals behave in a certain manner. \\n\\nBut anyways back to the confrontation, I told him about him touching me inappropriately last year and that it goes both ways if you want respect. He began calling me disgusting and saying that I take everything in a sexual way. We have not been on speaking terms and then a week or so before their daughter\u2019s birthday party, I called my SIL and explained my discomfort in being around him and also not being comfortable in having my little kids in his presence. After the party, I\u2019ve been called selfish for not attending and not allowing my kids to be there. She\u2019s (SIL) now blasting my phone sending me all sorts of hurtful messages including that he did nothing wrong because according to him I pushed him and that I was being so selfish in not attending and not allowing my kids to be there too.  But I\u2019m just not comfortable being around someone that will not hesitate to hurt me. \\n\\nAm I justified in my feelings or did I take things too far? I have voiced my feelings to the entire family and while they see my side, they also don\u2019t want to cause any problems with him and their main concern is that he will keep their grandkids from them.

Fiscal Deficit- The budgeted fiscal deficit for the current fiscal year is projected at 5.1%, down from 5.8% in the last fiscal year. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by FY26.\\n\\n2.) Capital Expenditure- Planned capital expenditure for this fiscal year is budgeted at \u20b911.1 lakh crore, up from \u20b99.5 lakh crore last year.\\n\\n3.) Tax Revenue- The Interim Budget projects gross tax revenue at \u20b938.31 lakh crore for 2024-25, reflecting an 11.46% growth over the previous fiscal year.  This includes \u20b921.99 lakh crore from direct taxes (personal income tax and corporate tax) and \u20b916.22 lakh crore from indirect taxes (customs, excise duty, GST).\\n\\n4.) GST- Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection for 2024-25 is estimated to rise to \u20b910.68 lakh crore, an increase of 11.6 per cent.\\n\\n5.) Borrowing- The government\'s gross borrowing for the current financial year is budgeted at \u20b914.13 lakh crore.\\n\\n6.) Nominal GDP- India\'s nominal GDP growth (real GDP plus inflation) for the current fiscal year is estimated at 10.5 per cent, reaching \u20b9327.7 trillion.\\n\\nReal GDP growth for the current fiscal year is projected at 7.2 per cent, according to the RBI.\\n\\n(Real GDP is calculated by dividing nominal GDP by a GDP deflator.)\\n\\n7.) Dividend- The Interim Budget had projected \u20b91.02 lakh crore from the RBI and financial institutions, but this will be revised upwards due to the RBI\'s surplus transfer of \u20b92.11 lakh crore in May. Additionally, \u20b943,000 crore is expected from Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).\\n\\n1.)

The Mudra loans are disbursed through PSU banks, Small Finance banks, and NBFC, hence the announcement of a limit extension will benefit companies like SBI, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, AU Small finance banks.\\n\\n4.) Limit of LTCG tax hiked from 10% to 12.5%\\n\\n5.) The finance minister has put the spotlight on the expedited closure of LLPs.

These steps will help ease the ease of doing business by helping improve the efficiency of corporate exits, which has been an issue in the country.\\n\\n6.) Govt\'s big push on Job creation in the manufacturing sector - This initiative will reimburse employers up to \u20b93,000 per month for two years towards EPFO contributions for each additional employee, aiming to incentivize the additional employment of 50 lakh people.\\n\\n7.) Customs duty on gold and silver to be reduced to 6%, platinum to 6.4%\\n\\n8.) Bringing investment in urban housing to \u20b910 lakh crore under PM AWAS Yojana Urban 2.0 is a quantum jump seen in the nation\'s response towards its urban housing crisis. A commitment of this magnitude for one crore families exhibits that the Centre is serious about making urban development inclusive. The contribution by Centre, which will be \u20b92.2 lakh crore over a period of five years, gives financial muscle to the scheme. This huge investment is most likely to have far-reaching effects beyond the simple provision of housing. It could stimulate the construction sector, create millions of jobs, and boost allied industries.\\n\\n9.) PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana has been launched to install rooftop solar panels to enable 1 crore households to obtain free electricity upto 300 units each month. This scheme will further encourage it.\\n\\n10.) Farmers have long been demanding MSP, and NDA allies are also calling for the revocation of the Agniveer Scheme. Employment, MSP, and inflation will be the key areas of focus. I can even reveal the Delhi budget now. For the past 9 years, Delhi has received no more than \u20b9325 crores, simply because the people of Delhi elected AAP.\\n\\n11.) the poor, women, youth and the farmer/ For farmers, we announced higher Minimum Support Prices for all major crops delivering on the promise for at least a 50% margin over cost. PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana was extended for 5 years benefitting more than 80 crore people.\\n\\n12.) Five schemes to focus on 4.1 crore youth over 5 years with a central outlay of \u20b92 lakh crore\\n\\n13.) 9 priorities are - \\n\\nProductivity and resilience in Agriculture\\nEmployment and skilling\\nInclusive HRD and social justice\\nMfg & services\\nUrban development\\nEnergy security\\nInfra\\nInnovation, R&D\\nNext generation reforms\\n\\n14.) Skilling focus - These schemes will be based on enrolment in the EPFO, focusing on recognizing first-time employees. First-timers will receive one month\'s wage upon entering the workforce in all formal sectors. A direct benefit transfer (DBT) of one month\'s salary, up to \u20b915,000, will be provided in three instalments. The eligibility limit for this benefit will be a salary of \u20b91 lakh per month, and it is expected to benefit 2.1 lakh youths.\\n\\n15.) financial support for loans up to \u20b910 lakh for higher education.\\n\\n16.) Employment push - The budget proposes significant benefits for new and additional employment to propel growth. 3 schemes are being announced which include one month wage upto 15,000 for first time employee with salary upto Rs.100,000. Benefit will disbursed in 3 Installment.\\n\\n17.) increasing the participation of women in the workforce will be a priority. This will be done by setting up hostels and creating partnerships to organize women-specific skilling programs.\\n\\n18.) the Prime Minister\'s package of 5 schemes and initiatives to facilitate employment, skilling and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over 5 years with a central outlay of \u20b92 lakh crores. This year we have made a provision of \u20b91.48 lakh crores for education, employment and skilling.\\n\\n19.) Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act- Our govt has made efforts to fulfil the commitments in Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act. Recognising the state\'s need for capital, we will facilitate special financial support through multilateral agencies. In the current FY, \u20b915,000 crore will be arranged with additional amounts in future years.\\n\\n20.) The limit of Mudra loans will be extended to \u20b920 lakh from \u20b910 lakh for those who have availed and paid previous loans.\\n\\n21.) A plan will be formulated for Purvodaya for all round development of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh. Patna-Purnya expressway, Buxar-Bagalpur expressway, Bodhgaya-Rajgir-Vaishali-Darbanga spurs, and additional two-lane bridge over Ganga at Baksar at \u20b926,000crore, she said. Power projects, including 2400 MW power plant at Pir Payanti to be taken up at \u20b921,400crore.\\n\\n22.) 2.66 lakh crore for rural development and 2.2 lakh crore for urban housing\\n\\n23.) to facilitate term loans for MSMEs for the purchase of machinery and equipment without collateral and guarantee, a new scheme will be introduced. This guarantee fund will provide guarantees of up to \u20b9100 crore.\\n\\n24.) Govt to launch scheme to offer internship in top companies to one crore youth in five years\\n\\n25.) Gaya and Mahabodhi temples to get corridors, Nalanda to be transformed into tourism hub\\n\\n26.) one crore youth will receive internship opportunities in the top 500 companies, with an allowance of \u20b95000 per month and \u20b96000 as one-time assistance. This significant investment in skill development programs and the incentivization of industries to adopt comprehensive apprenticeships lays a solid foundation for a future-ready workforce.

It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!\\n\\nThe human brain is terrible at remembering information.\\n\\nWhen we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.\\n\\nOne of the biggest consequences of this is at work.\\n\\nYou clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think \u201cWhere did all that time go?\u201d\\n\\nEven worse, if YOU can\u2019t remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?\\n\\nIn an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They\u2019ll notice all the hard work you\u2019re putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you\u2019ve written.\\n\\nBut we don\u2019t live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.\\n\\n**Enter The Brag Document**\\n\\nBy recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you\u2019ve achieved.\\n\\nAnd these \u201cwins\u201d don\u2019t need to be Olympic Gold Medals.\\n\\nDid you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.\\n\\nDid you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.\\n\\nDid you help mentor a junior employee? That\u2019s definitely part of it.\\n\\nOver time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.\\n\\nSure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.\\n\\nBut the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.\\n\\nYour wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.\\n\\nUse your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don\u2019t want to do anymore.\\n\\n**The Pareto Principle**\\n\\nThe Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.\\n\\nAt work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.\\n\\nUse this 20% to ask yourself questions like:\\n\\n* Is there a common theme amongst this work?\\n* Are there topics here that I thought I didn\u2019t actually like but turns out I do?\\n* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?\\n* How can I do more of this work?\\n\\n**Frequency**\\n\\nUpdate your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.\\n\\nThe biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.\\n\\nLet\u2019s say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.\\n\\nThere\u2019s a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you\u2019re just stuck somewhere you don\u2019t want to be?\\n\\n**Collaborate**\\n\\nTalk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll often find that they\u2019re able to mention things you completely forgot or didn\u2019t even seem to think about.\\n\\nRemember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.\\n\\nYou should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other\u2019s wins. This builds a strong team culture.\\n\\n**Your Manager**\\n\\nYou should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.\\n\\nIt might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \\\\- you\u2019re basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.\\n\\nIf your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you\u2019re good at and what you can improve on.\\n\\nEven better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.\\n\\nTell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.\\n\\nYou\u2019ll both be able to identify areas in which you\u2019re doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.\\n\\nAnother aspect that\u2019s helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.\\n\\nYou should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think \u201cWait..what was the point again?\u201d\\n\\nBy using your brag document to set goals, you\u2019ll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.\\n\\n\\\\----\\n\\nHope this was helpful - original article source [here](https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork)","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/hp237n/ysk_keeping_a_brag_document_of_your_little_wins/","datetime":"2020-07-11 07:44:57 IST","votes":6824,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"What is a typical ADHD trait that doesn\'t apply to you?","author":"toocritical55","url":"https://reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1dghl4i/what_is_a_typical_adhd_trait_that_doesnt_apply_to/","subreddit":"ADHD","body":"[removed]","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1dghl4i/what_is_a_typical_adhd_trait_that_doesnt_apply_to/","datetime":"2024-06-15 18:37:20 IST","votes":1428,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"You\'ve Got Motivation All Wrong. Let Me Explain: [discussion] \\n","author":"Latter-Vehicle-6648","url":"https://reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/1cq6y9q/youve_got_motivation_all_wrong_let_me_explain/","subreddit":"GetMotivated","body":"\\nIf you\'re in this subreddit, you\'ve probably seen thousands of pieces of advice, thousands of quotes, hundreds of neuroscientific interventions and potential pills to help you \'finally become the person you\'ve always wanted to become.\' \\n\\nNow I dont want to sound too dramatic, but genuinely, nearly all of this is bullshit. The self improvement industry sells you lies left right and centre. \\n\\n\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206 Disclaimer: This will take you 5-10 mins to read, but by the end of it, you\'ll probably never have to come on this subreddit ever again or read anything else on discipline. \u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206\u2206\\n\\n\\n# Diagnosing the Bullshit:\\n\\n  \\nLet me explain.\\n\\nSo let\'s say you are 20 years old. Right now, your brain has spent 20 whole years not only developing, but PERFECTING its neural connections, to make you into the person you are today.\\n\\nIt has devoted quite literally thousands upon thousands of days towards habits in your life that you probably dont even recognise to be \'habits.\'\\n\\nDo you find it easy to buy stuff online? Open the fridge? Turn on your phone first thing in the morning? Walk to the shop to buy junk food? Play video games?  Turn on a porn site? \\n\\nQuite literally anything and everything you do, is a result of fine-tuned neural connections that the brain has perfected because you\'ve done these things so many times consistently. \\n\\n  \\nWhen you do any task, your brain releases an amount of dopamine. Dopamine isn\'t the \'happy\' chemical that people think it is. It is primarily the neurochemical involved in \'doing things\'- so any time you do anything, your brain releases dopamine, so that the next time you do that task, because dopamine helps you to \'do things\', by releasing it, the brain reinforces that behaviour, and makes that task slightly easier to do next time you want to do it.\\n\\nSo yeah to reiterate your brain right now is a highly efficient machine, and it does not like to be swayed off course from what it already knows.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nWell as far as your evolutionary brain is concerned, all the habits you\'ve built over your 20 years of life, have allowed you to survive. \\n\\nYour ancient brain thinks all the things you do, all the junk food you eat, all the bullshit you do, is actually maximising its chances to survive on the Savannah. \\n\\nObviously no matter what habits you pick, if you live in a relatively safe country, you probably will survive in the world regardless, but your evolutionary brain doesn\'t know that. All it knows is that the way you do things right now are optimal for survival.\\n\\n  \\nAnd that means your brain really fucking loves to do things how it\'s always done things. It HATES CHANGE. Because change quite literally could be life or death for your brain. So it will fight you tooth and nail to avoid change.\\n\\n  \\nThis is where the bullshit of the self improvement industry comes in. \'Change your life in 30 days\', \'Change your life in 3 months\', \'How I became a disciplined person overnight.\'\\n\\nEverything about your brain hates these statements. \\n\\nAnd at this stage you may say, \'Oh but Mr Latter Vehicle 6648, what about David Goggins?\' or whatever self improvement person you look up to, who \'changed their life overnight.\'\\n\\nThis is going to be controversial, but I think people like Goggins are actually just mentally ill. Dont tune out just yet though, let me explain.\\n\\nI dont mean mentally ill in a bad way. This isn\'t to disrespect the work people like him have done. But the ability to just \'flip a switch\' and become a hard motherfucker, is so incredibly biologically abnormal, that it must be something insane like 0.00000000001% of people are able to sustain that- and I would imagine their ability to flip that switch is tied to years of hard trauma in their childhood, which most people who\'ve come from a stable background, simply cant relate to. Thats not to discredit people like Goggins, im just saying, I think people like that have a form of \'positively impactful\' mental illness.\\n\\nThat\'s to say, they are mentally ill, but it actually works for their life, so we dont talk about it in those terms. And it makes sense, like why would we create names for mental conditions that help people improve their lives? There\'s no point. \\n\\nBut it\'s super important to recognise that these people are not a narrative to base your life on, just like you wouldn\'t take advice from someone with severe schizophrenia. \\n\\nSo getting back on track here, when you try to implement any piece of advice from the self improvement industry heres how it always goes: \\n\\n1. You try something new when you\'re super motivated\\n2. You completely transform your entire life for a week, 2 weeks, a month, or hell even 2 months for some people\\n3. Then randomly you wake up one day and its all fallen apart and you cant work out why.\\n\\nAnd then you probably spend the next 12 months saying to yourself- \'man I wish I could just get back into that state of mind I had when I was super motivated\'- but that state of mind never comes back, and if it does you just end up replaying the whole cycle again, and it falls off like it always does, again. \\n\\nThe reason you \'fall off\' as I\'ve mentioned is because your brain HATES change. So if you change everything, you\'re basically just biding your time, waiting for the day that you run out of cognitive energy to be motivated, and your brain goes back to the safe habits it knows best.\\n\\nOne hard truth you must accept is, your brain has spent 20 fucking years developing and strengthening its bad connections to make you how you are right now, so how the fuck do you expect 30 or even 60 measly days to flip that all around with a stupid \'30 day plan.\'\\n\\nWhat life do you think your brain will pick? The disciplined one that you\'ve tried to stick at for 30 days, or the one that you\'ve hardwired and stuck at for 7 THOUSAND 300 days (20 yrs)? \\n\\n30 is a very small figure compared to 7300. No wonder you fail to make any progress. \\n\\nThe quicker you accept how your brain works, and remove the ego involved in trying to quickly transform yourself, the quicker you will actually become the person you want to become.\\n\\nIf you ever want to change, you have to accept your brain for what it is and say to yourself \'ok brain, we CAN keep doing things your way, and in fact we are going to embrace things your way, but we are going to ALSO make some minor changes that you won\'t even notice ok?\'\\n\\n\\n\\n# Real Habit Building\\n\\nAnd this is where ideas like atomic habits come in. if you want to be the kind of person that goes to the gym, then you need to make changes so so small, but progressive, towards going to the gym, that your brain doesn\'t even notice you\'re making these changes. \\n\\nNow crucially, im going to break down what a habit actually is, because this is another point that the self improvement industry lies to you about.\\n\\n  \\nThe self improvement industry has a tendency to call something one habit, when its actually like 12.\\n\\nLet me explain.\\n\\nFor example,  the habit of \'going to the gym\', is not one habit. Firstly going to the gym, might involve:\\n\\nWaking up at a reasonable time (one habit), getting out of bed (two habits), getting your gym clothes on (three habits), getting your keys and wallet/ water bottle (three habits), making sure to pack your gym bag (four habits), locking up your house (five habits), opening the door getting outside when perhaps you dont like being outside (six habits), walking to the gym for an extended period of time of like 5-30 minutes (7 habits), and ONLY THEN when you arrive at the gym, have you completed your seemingly \'one habit\'.\\n\\nNo wonder your brain gets overwhelmed and refuses to go to the gym- it\'s like 7 changes simultaneously all wrapped up in the false assumption it\'s 1 change. \\n\\nLots of people may find that going to the gym is less than 7 habits though, they may find that \'waking up\', getting dressed, going outside and walking, is how they can mentally break it down- so more like 3 habits instead.\\n  \\nBut however many habits you think going to the gym is, is entirely dependant on just how different your current life is from the life you want to lead. \\n\\nSo if your somebody that usually walks to work and is happy waking up at an early hour and is pretty well disciplined in normal ways, then going to the gym may actually even be \'one habit\' as people think it is.\\n  \\nBut if you\'re the kind of person that hates being outside, you wake up late every day, you spend multiple hours on your phone, you go to bed late, and you never work out, then going the gym MUST be seen as 7 separate steps, because each one of those steps is unfamiliar to your brain.\\n\\nIt is better to assume your brain is unfamiliar with a task than to assume it can conquer it easily. It is easy to get excited and carried away with the prospect of habit building such that you want to change a million things at once, but it is much more reliable if you change just one thing at a time.\\n\\nThis is where you have to kill your ego and completely detach yourself from results based progress. Please trust me on this, because if you follow my methods, you will be able to maintain any habit you want for the rest of your entire life, so just because it may seem a little slow, it will reap unimaginably large rewards for you for the rest of your life. so just trust me on this, kill your ego, detach yourself from results and be patient. \\n\\nIf your goal is to go to the gym, and this is something entirely unfamiliar to you, you must start with habit one, which let\'s say is getting dressed for the gym.\\n\\nYou must get dressed for the gym every single day, but make sure thats all you do. you stick to just that one habit, and you commit to it for an entire month. after that month your brain won\'t even think about getting ready for the gym it will be the easiest task in the world.\\n\\nThis is where month two you then get into the habit of actually being outside. I used to hate going on walks and being outside. So I spent an entire month literally just making sure after I woke up I would stand outside. There was no condition for me to walk anywhere or do anything, simply being comfortable being outside was unfamiliar to my brain, so cognitively was a big step.\\n\\n  \\nMonth three, go for a walk/ get in your car to go to the gym. at this stage the preparation phase for the gym is like clockwork, you could do it in your sleep its that easy for you. Now for this whole month you simply drive/ walk to the gym. Honestly at this stage as crazy as it sounds, I wouldn\'t even enter the gym. simply being there every day was testament to all the progress I was making.\\n\\n  \\nOnly then on month four would I enter the gym and do a workout. But I would make sure the workout is quick because again actually working out is an unfamiliar place for my brain so I dont want to go into a whole 1 hr workout, because I know if I do that, then for no reason, im going to wake up one day paralysed and incapable of mustering the will to go to the gym, because 1 hr is too long and I won\'t want to do it, so it will all fall apart \\n\\nSo for month four, I will workout for 15 minutes. you can make that even shorter if you want. Remember DO NOT ATTACH YOURSELF TO THE RESULTS. Your only attachment should be to honouring your word and completing the habit.\\n\\n  \\nFor month 5 you can then increase the length of your workout if you want, maybe to 20 minutes, then the next month to 30 minutes. \\n\\n# Where it gets exciting\\n\\nThis is where shit gets really cool. by building habits in this way you can very quickly after like 5-6 months, utilise principles of compound interest.\\n\\n Once you are at the gym, if you increase the intensity of your workouts or the length of your workouts by lets say 20% a month then through compound interest this will happen:\\n\\nLet\'s say you start small, so once you make it to that gym, you start with 5 minutes of gym time a day.\\n\\nIf you increase your time by 20% each month, by the second month, you\'ll be there for 6 minutes a day.\\n\\nContinuing this pattern, by the end of 12 months, you\'ll be there for nearly 31 minutes daily.\\n\\nYou may say at this stage, hmmm yeah but 30 mins isn\'t that much. \\n\\nBut my friend compound interest is just getting started. If you carried on increasing your time by 20% at 12 months this is what would happen.\\n\\n12 months- 30 mins per day\\n\\n13 months- 36 mins per day\\n\\n14 months- 43.2 mins per day\\n\\n15 months- 52 mins per day\\n\\n16 months- 1hr 2 mins per day\\n\\n17 months- 1hr 14 mins per day\\n\\n18 months (1.5 years)- 1hr 30 mins per day. \\n\\nWow. So with only 6 more months of slow increases, you went from 30 mins at the gym to 1hr 30 mins. EVERY SINGLE DAY. \\n\\nThis illustrates how small, consistent increases can DRAMATICALLY  boost your progress over time, much like how compound interest works with money.\\n\\nAnd this principle can be applied to any habit you want to build. Make the changes so small that your brain doesn\'t notice, make sure the habit you are focusing on is a specific action and then keep a set percentage increase in the intensity/ duration of the habit and watch how you reap the rewards. \\n\\nYou could start ANY habit this way. if you want to read books and you dont read books, the self improvement industry would probably suggest you read 15 pages a day.\\n\\nNo. Kill the ego. if you dont like reading but you want to read, then 15 pages a day is a lot of fucking reading and you will give up very quickly.\\n  \\nInstead, for a whole month read one paragraph. I\'m deadly serious. Not even a page. One paragraph- because you brain can then develop that network from the ground up- the action of picking up the book and actually committing to reading it even for one paragraph is actively and positively rewiring your brain.\\n\\nAnd then the next month you may read 2 paragraphs, then 3 paragraphs then 1 page, then 2 pages, then 3 pages, then 5 pages, then 7 pages, then 10 pages, then 15 pages and BOOM before you know it after a handful of months you will be the kind of person that finds it easy to read books every single day. \\n\\n# Where it gets even more exciting\\n\\nNow you can concretely see how much progress you are going to make in under 2 years. 2 years is nothing in the grand scheme of your whole life and yet these 2 years will transform how you do everything. Crazy stuff. \\n\\nSomething I\'ve done to keep me excited about progress is write myself a note on my phone, laying out all the habits I want to start, and then writing down all the progression that are going to occur to those habits. \\n\\nAnd it\'s so so so exciting, because I can see with my own eyes that by this time next year for example, I\'ll be doing 100 press ups every single day, going on a RUN every single day (I naturally hate running), Ill be waking up early and countless other habits that are helping me towards my career. \\n\\nSo start a note on your phone or make a physical record of the habits you want to start and what progressions they are going to have each month, so you can see yourself just how successful you\'re going to be in your life.\\n\\n# *ROOKIE MISTAKES TO AVOID:*\\n\\n  \\nI could talk about this stuff for ages, but ill finish by mentioning pitfalls you DO NOT want to fall into:\\n\\n***Do not get cocky. The self improvement industry would tell you that you should start scaling up your habits after a week or two weeks of doing it. DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS.\\n\\n  \\n***WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT SCALE UP YOUR HABITS UNTIL A MINIMUM A MONTH OF DOING THEM, A MONTH IS THE MINIMUM. \\n\\n***Secondly, do NOT juggle too many new habits at once. \\n\\nYou may think you are building 4 small habits- lets say you decided that you want to: \\n\\nGo on walk every morning, meditate daily, have a skincare routine, and go on a run in the evening. \\n\\nYou may then think \'oh ok, so on month one lets do a small habit towards the walk, a small habit towards the meditating, a small habit towards the skincare routine and a small habit towards the evening run- what\'s the big deal right?\' NO. \\n\\n***IF YOU TAKE AWAY ONE MESSAGE FROM THIS TODAY, IT IS THAT YOUR BRAIN DETESTS CHANGE.\\n\\nSo if you do 4 \'small\' changes at once, thats 4 x the amount of change, and thus a lot more cognitive load on your brain than you may think it is.\\n\\nImagine I gave you a 0.5kg dumbbell in one arm to curl. You\'d probably feel nothing from curling it. The change would go under the radar. \\n\\nBut if I instead gave you 8 of those dumbbells suddenly I\'m actually lifting 4kg of weight. I would notice this weight a lot more and perhaps feel a bit uncomfortable with it.\\n\\nThis is like your brain when you try to start too many small changes at once. So don\'t do it. Stick to one habit for now. \\n\\n If you want to build multiple habits simultaneously, only do that once you are comfortable having built one habit at a time for a while. \\n\\n# In summary\\n\\n*Your brain hates change. The self improvement industry sells you too much change and false narratives around change.*\\n\\n*But if you follow the principles I\'ve laid out, you not only can grow sustainable habits but very VERY excitingly, they will be built on such a solid foundation in your brain, that you will be able to keep them going for the rest of your life if you choose to do so.*\\n  \\nAnyway I think ive typed too much as it is, so let me know if any of this was helpful, I hope my advice can help at least one person to improve themselves.

This post is about how you can ace the first few months of your MBA college, regardless of your college or its rankings.\\n\\nSection 1: Placement Committee\\n\\nPlacement committee is the group of students who help with placements. They reach out to and onboard recruiters, prepare students and facilitate the hiring process. Second year placement committee members get the first year students placed and vice versa. Around 80% of the placement committee members get the best jobs on the campus. But they also need to work very hard. During placement cycles, they typically get 4-5 hours of sleep, and have poor social life. If you are inclined to join the placement committee, here is how you can prepare.\\n\\n1. Temperament: placement committee members selection happens in the first few weeks. A placement committee member should be calm and professional at all times. Even if you are not, you need to pretend to be this. Pre joining your college and after joining it, don\'t get into any controversy. Don\'t pick fights on WhatsApp groups or do anything that makes you look mercurial. Be respectful to your seniors and do what they say, even if they are being absurd. A junior placement committee member needs to be someone that the senior placement committee members can train and mould. So pretend to be a subservient junior who is always respecting and looking for guidance from their seniors. Having said that, always pretend to have impeccable honesty.\\n\\n2. Information: You will have several rounds of interview before you are selected in the placement committee. These rounds would include a range of things like tasks (prepare a presentation you\'d give to a new recruiter on why they should come to your campus), stress interviews, role plays (talk to an angry HR who wants to blacklist your college because some student from your campus fucked up), prospecting (get names and numbers of 20 HR recruiters) etc. You can start preparing for these interviews from right now. Carefully read your college\'s placement reports for the last 5 years. Put the data on a sheet, try to find patters, any insights you can tell in your placement committee interviews (example in the last 5 years, we have had less companies from BFSI fields, we should reach out to recruiters from this domain). Now do the same for your peer MBA colleges. By peer colleges, I mean colleges where the median CTC is just as yours, and you both feature +/- 5 in all relevant rankings. Look at hard numbers, the median, average ctc, batch profiles, learn terms like mep, audited report, difference between rsu and espos etc. Other than placement reports, NIRF reports and mandatory discolorue reports for all colleges have far more data on placement stats.\\n\\nPlacement committee interviews are often a test of your grit and perseverance. There will be many rounds, at odd hours. Theyll girll you, learn to say sorry and accept your mistakes.\\n\\nThis makes it look like the placement committee is the place to be, but in most colleges, placement committee is a cesspool of toxicity, abuse and bullying. That discussion is for another day. But if placements are your primary focus, you need try to get into the placement committee\\n\\nSection 2: Timeline\\n\\nThis is the timeline for 2 MBA programs. Things might change in your college by +/- 2 months.\\n\\nSemester 1: June- Sept 2024: You enter the college. The first few days are the hoax week, where the seniors or the second year MBA students will try to soft-rag you. Endure if you can, don\'t participate if you can\'t. It will stop in a few days, the seniors will tell you it was all a prank and you all start afresh. Now committee selections start. There are many student run committees in a college like the placement committee. Some committees like the student affairs, or the finance or the consulting committee can have a lot of heft on your campus and it might be a good idea to join them. But more or less, other than the placement committee, membership of no other committee has a lot of impact on your placements. They are good way to find and network with some like minded people on your campus. You will also start working on your CVs. To make a good CV, take an excel sheet and start writing your autobiography, ever cell is one event in your life. Example: 8th standard results, 8th standard 100m race runner up etc. Write down as many achivements as you can, no matter how small or distant they are. Now audit, for how many of these achivements, do you have a proof? Proof is something which shows that the achievement happened without doubt. For example you say that your boss at work gave you the best employee award. If your placement committee member sends an email to your boss on their work email id, will they reply back? That is what I mean by proofs. Remove all the achivements without proofs, now the remaining achivements with proofs are your CV pointers. You will mix and match to make them your CV. Something like: Recived top grades in 18/23 courses in the first year of engineering is also an achivement, something you can prove easily. So open an excel sheet and start noting all your achievements like these.\\n\\nSemester 2: Oct-Dec 2024: This is the Summer internship selection semester. Summer internship is the 2-3 month internship program that you\'ll do in 2025 summer as a part of your MBA program. Companies of all types will come on your campus, shortlist some students based on CV/aptitude tests and select from them via GD/PI. The exact process of selection varies across campuses but for most, in happens in clusters and day wise.\\n\\nSemester 3: Jan-Mar 2025: This is pretty much the semester where all the events and parties take place. Have fun :)\\n\\nSummer Internship: April-June 2025: Based on the company that selects you, you go to work with them for 2-3 months. This is usually very hectic because you will have co-interns from other b schools and everyone will be fighting for PPOs. Pre placement offers (PPO) are awarded by companies based on your performance in summer internships. If you get a PPO, and you accept the PPO then your summer internship company promises to hire you once you are done with your MBA in a year. This is a win win, as the company could test you and block you in advance and you are pretty much done with your MBA since you are now placed. In tier 1 b schools, you are allowed to reject your PPOs, tier 2 and 3 b schools would not be this flexible.\\n\\nSemester 4: July-Sept 2025: You are now a senior! Congratulations! If you have a PPO, you are sorted. If you don\'t, you move your gears towards working on your final placements.  This semester is primarily spent on selecting your juniors in your clubs and committees and guiding them for their summer internship preparation. This semester also has a lot of case competitions. These are essentially competitions that many companies host on platforms like Unstop, Mettle etc. A case competition is typically a problem like: Help PepsiCo launch a new healthy drink. You make a solution and compete with other teams across b schools. Winning teams are offered cash prizes and sometimes an opportunity to intern or interview with the host company, PepsiCo in this case. Case competitions therefore are a great way to get an offer outside the traditional placement process.\\n\\nSemester 5: Oct-Dec 2025: Similar to Semester 4. For some colleges the placement process starts. These are called the final placements where all the students who didn\'t get, or rejected their PPO are invited. Typically 40-70% of the batch sits for the final placement. The same cycle repeats, you make your CV, you give tests, get shortlisted, go for GD/PI and the get final offers. \\n\\nSemester 6: Jan-March 2026: The final placements are staggered so they sometimes spill over to this semester. This is also when you have your farewells and a lot of events.\\n\\nPost March 2026: You have your convocation, you take trips with your friends and by June 2026, you join the company you got either via your summer placement PPO or case competition or final placements.\\n\\nSection 3: Finances\\n\\nYour fees can vary from 20-30 lakhs. Tier 1 college students typically get loans easily without any collateral or co-borrower. The rate varies from 7-9%. You will also get a 6 month moratorium, which means you will need to start paying your EMIs from November 2026 onwards. The EMI can range from 25-35 thousand per month depending on the tenure of your loan.\\n\\nFor tier 2 and 3 colleges, the difficulty to secure loan would increase. You might now need a collateral and/or a co-borrower like a parent.\\n\\nCTC: Your package can vary from 20-30 lakhs depending on your college. Good companies typically have a straightforward CTC with no absurd or confusing components like huge variable pays, ESOPS, huge joining/retention bonus etc.\\n\\nAs a general rule, take the median package of your college. Lets say is 20 lakhs. Now multiple that with 70%, 14 lakhs, thats your post tax in-hand CTC after removing Gratuity/PF etc. If your fees is 20 lakhs, then your EMI will be around 25k, which is 3 lakhs per year. 14-3 is 11 lakhs. So your in hand income post tax and post education loan emi will be around 90k. Your company will likely be in a metro, the expenses there will be around 50k. You\'ll have 40k per month to save or use for big expenses like vacations, savings etc. These are very generalised numbers. I would recommend you make an excel sheet and try to get the exact numbers based on your college and situation. This will help you set realistic expectations about life post MBA.\\n\\nSection 4: Academics\\n\\nEvery college, no matter what tier, has both, good professors and bad. Ask your seniors and try to find the good ones. Some young professors can be a great source of learning and guidance too. I usually recommend to skip engaging a lot with bad profs (bad content, bad delivery or both). You can easily compensate the learnings of the bad profs from YouTube, Coursera or old school methods like Library.\\n\\nGrades don\'t really matter for summer internship since you don\'t have enough grades released by then, but they do matter in the final placements as many companies shortlist based on your MBA grades.\\n\\nSome colleges have a culture of failing 5-10% of the batch. Failing a year might mean repeating or dropping out of MBA altogether. Talk to seniors and make sure that you understand the academic rigour on your campus and prioritise your commitment to academics accordingly.\\n\\nSection 5: Love, friendships and networking\\n\\nLove: colleges are a great way of finding relationships and more. Since average age of an incoming student is 24, most people are more mature and clear about what they want. Be open to new experience, and allow yourself to feel love. Do what you like, and don\'t judge others for what they want for themselves. As long as its consensual, everything is ok. Your values are not universal, dont look at others from that lens.\\n\\nFriendships: some people make good groups and have a great time. Some stay solo all through 2 years. Do what you like. It can be hard to break into groups and its ok. My only advice is to be kind and generous. Help everyone you can, respect people and their choices, don\'t gossip or pick fights and you\'ll most likely end up with friends for life and some great groups to party and have fun with.\\n\\nNetworking: This is every introverts\'s nightmare. I don\'t want to lie to you and tell you that networking doesn\'t matter. It does. Your batchmates and juniors and seniors will give you refferals, leads and help you when you need it. If you are an introvert, my advice is that you figure out what triggers your anxiety and work accordingly. Lets say you can\'t talk to people in person, no worries. Let\'s make a nice LinkedIn account and reach out to your seniors from a few years ago. Ask them on LinkedIn DMs if they can review your CV or guide about what you can expect if you get a job in their field. If they say yes, get on the call and talk. Recent graduates will generously give you time and this is what networking is. It will give you confidence to do this in person with your batchmates and co-interns.\\n\\nMiscellaneous: Campuses in non-probation states will have a culture of alcohol and other intoxicatants. Its ok if you don\'t wanna do it, don\'t judge others who are doing it. If you want to do it, make sure you don\'t over do it.\\n\\nSection 6: Pre-MBA\\n\\nDoctors: Visit your GP, dentist and psychiatrist. If you have never visited them before, find a nice one. Tell them you will be going through very hectic 2 years, what should you do. They\'ll offer general check up, blood work and maybe some SOS pills if needed. Do this to get on top of your health, especially mentally. If you haven\'t been through a rough mental health patch in a few years or ever, now is a good time to reflect and prevent damage in future. Learn vocabulary for your feelings like anxiety, depression, your relationship with food, stress, attachment styles etc. Don\'t take this part lightly, we need to look after ourselves.\\n\\nFriends and relationships: Long distance relationships find it very hard to survive a MBA because the non-MBA partner typically does not understand the haste and the bullshit that happens here. Make sure you build a strong base if you are taking your relationship with you on the campus. You will barely get any time for your relationship in the first few months, and no time for your friends back home. Make sure your friends know that this is the hectic life of MBA and not your disinterest in them. I feel like scheduling 1 hour video call every Sunday afternoon is a nice way to keep LDR friends group active. Make sure you have very strong friendships outside MBA to keep you sane on lonely days in the campus.\\n\\nClothes and grooming: Do whatever it takes to make you feel confident on the campus. It can be from getting a hair patch for your balding head to start learning how to do make up. Change your fashion style. Ask your siblings or friends with better style to redo your wardrobe. MBA is a great time to reinvent yourself. Let go of stupid judgements and gender roles and do whatever that helps you feel good.\\n\\nCommunication style: Fluent English, both written and verbal will help. Speak infront of a mirror and record yourself if needed. Speak slowly and use simple words. 1-2 month before your MBA starts is good enough time to polish some dull edges.\\n\\nSkills: Make sure your Excel and PowerPoint skills are good. You\'ll find enough tutorials on YouTube to practice and sharpen your skills. Both these programs are a bedrock of any MBA grad.\\n\\nSection 7: Closing Advice \\n\\nMy MBA journey was incredible and I am very grateful for that. I wishing the same for all of you, if you join this year or next. \\n\\nEvery MBA campus has an unique culture and a story. Make sure you share your colors with the campus and take some of it from the campus too. Look after everyone around you, everyone needs help. Through bad days and good, remember that MBA at best is just 2% of your life. There is a lot more exciting stuff left!!\\n\\nI won\'t be able to take DMs, so please comment if you want to ask me something. All the best!!\\n\\n\\n","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1cgv3qj/users_guide_to_mba_the_first_few_months/","datetime":"2024-04-30 20:35:26 IST","votes":845,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Words of Wisdom ",""],"archived":true},{"title":"To all the folks joining MBA this year, here are some tips from 2024 Tier 1 passout.","author":"lizlemon008","url":"https://reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1cfrafc/to_all_the_folks_joining_mba_this_year_here_are/","subreddit":"CATpreparation","body":"1. Prepare yourself for some institutionalised ragging prevalent in almost all colleges. It may range from innocuous leg pulling to outright harassment in some places. Seniors will be unbelievably and deliberately harsh and rude to you throughout the first few weeks. You will be given assignments, tasks and projects with unbelievable and sometimes impossible deadlines. Try your best but also keep in mind that most seniors are just being over the top. All of them will mellow out later on.\\n2. First two trimesters are going to be extremely hectic academic wise. Create a plan by consulting seniors. Most subjects have a method of doing good in them in terms of past papers, teaching style, notes etc. Coax those secrets out from seniors. Don\'t be afraid to use ChatGPT but make sure that it is not completely copy-pasted. Also, take care of your sleep. 4-5 hours are a must for your mind to function properly.\\n3. Prepare your CVs as soon as possible. See old samples and compare your own with them. Watch videos regarding action words, impact points and things like that. Collect all proofs for all the points you are including. Prepare CVs for all domains accordingly and get them verified from your mentors asap. This will give you time to start preparing for interviews. Mock interviews are a great way to find chinks in your armour and improve them.\\n4. Make good friends. Your circle will decide a lot of how your MBA life will pan out. Most people are 25+ but still kids by heart and mind. Jealousy, cheating, backstabbing is common as is harassment during parties and drinking/drugs sessions. Be responsible and always be in control of your own self and surroundings. Keep in mind that placements and good grades triumph everything else.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1cfrafc/to_all_the_folks_joining_mba_this_year_here_are/","datetime":"2024-04-29 10:59:20 IST","votes":440,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Words of Wisdom ",""],"archived":true},{"title":"[Arrange Marriage] What should I ask her in the first meet??

Why would it not improve? When would it improve? For Dummies","author":"justamanhehe","url":"https://reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1c3nh8w/why_placement_scenario_is_bad_why_would_it_not/","subreddit":"CATpreparation","body":"Disclaimer: This is for people who barely read the newspaper. If you are aware of these happenings, please don\'t mind the simplifications I would do and nuances I would ignore. I\'m going to try to make it as simple as possible to understand. \\n\\nLet\'s start. This is going to be a long post (longer than aeon essays) so please bear with me. I\'ll try to make sure it\'s not boring. If you read till the end, you won\'t regret I promise. \\n\\nSo let me take you back to 2016. Things are going well. Captain America: Civil War has just come out. Most of you are probably still dreaming to become an ISRO scientist or go to IIT Bombay. You are listening to Arijit Singh\'s \\"Dekha Hazaro Dafa Aapko\\" and thinking about your crush. \\n\\nBut miles apart, Donald Trump wins the US presidential elections. This is important because a different party has come to power after staying in opposition for 8 long years. \\n\\nAnd in the background, China is rising. It\'s getting stronger decade by decade. In 2013,\xa0 If you had any political awareness, all you would know is, there\'s a new Gandhi look like called Anna Hazare. But in the same year, China gets a new president, Xi Jinping. \\n\\nXi Jinping was different from Hu Jintao, the previous president. Xi was more aggressive, more vocal about china replacing the USA as a superpower and that was a problem for USA. \\n\\nNaturally, this became a huge reason why the people of the United States voted for trump and voted against the party in power. And Trump, did exactly what he promised. \\n\\nProposal was simple. China is strong because China is rich. China is rich because china sells. China sells because we buy. If we don\'t buy, China won\'t stay strong. and Hence the trade war between China and United States began. \\n\\nThis stressed the global economy. Even India was in an economic slowdown in 2019. And at this point, Covid hit us. The stressed supply chains were disrupted. Investors became gloomy. Markets crashed. Growth stagnated. There was a point where experts thought things are as bad as they possible could be. But nothing was more wrong then this assessment, as the world would soon find out. \\n\\nIn 2022, Russia invades Ukraine. And to be honest, Ukraine is not as important of a country as it is made out to be. Many countries have invaded many countries before. It\'s not a big deal. But then, what was? It was the sanctions. \\n\\nThe entire west came in support of Ukraine and a lot of sanctions were imposed on Russia. But two of these sanctions are very important to understand more deeply. \\n\\nFirst is sanctions on buying energy from Russia. Europe\'s economy thrived on cheap energy from Russia. Despite high labour costs, this cheap energy was what made Europe competitive (among other things like infrastructure and technology). But when this inflow of energy stopped, things started to go bad for europe. On top of it, heavy expenditures were done by Europe in sending billions of aid to Ukraine. That compounded the economic problem of europe. \\n\\nBut then, there\'s a different less talked less discussed sanction on Russia. Sanction on using SWIFT system. But before I explain this sanction to you, let me explain to you the single reserve status of US dollar and what that means. \\n\\nSingle reserve status basically means that all countries trade using US dollars only. \\n\\nImagine India wants to buy 50 Rafale fighter jet from france for 400 Billion US Dollars. What would India do to get 400 Billion USD? There are two options \\n\\n1. Sell something India made and earn profit (agricultural produce, software, automobiles etc) \\n\\n2. Take loan from either multi national institutes like World Bank, individual countries like france, Japan or issue bonds for general public and businessmen. \\n\\nBut let\'s say, USA wants to buy 50 Rafale jets for 400 billion dollars. What would they have to do? \\n\\nPRINT. \\n\\nYes. Actually. Because all trade happens in US dollars, US can just print money out of thin air and buy stuff. Whenever US does this, the amount of US dollars in the world increases. When money increases, inflation increases. \\n\\nSo if India prints a lot of rupees, inflation would come in India. \\nBut when US prints a lot of dollars, inflation comes in the entire world. because entire world uses dollars. So america just exports it\'s inflation. (CRAZYYY I KNOWW) \\n\\nSo, how US dollar became a single currency reserve is a different story, but the truth is, it became. \\n\\nSo now, for India to buy 400 billion usd worth of rafale, we would have to earn money, convert that into dollars and pay those dollars to france and it\'s upto France to convert that back into euro or keep it in dollars. \\n\\nThis entire converting of rupees into dollars then paying france and france converting back happens on a system called SWIFT system. \\n\\nThe second sanction put on Russia was, that Russia can no longer use SWIFT system. Russia had some 600 Billion US dollars. This was the money they had earned. And within a minute, this was freezed and Russia was denied the right to use this money, or send or receive payments in US dollars. The crazy part is, USA alone did this. USA did not need permission from any other country to do this. United Nations was not involved. USA alone denied russia right to use it\'s own money to trade with countries other than Russia. \\n\\nThis was scary because the moment this happened, all countries thought, Oh that\'s what US could do to us in future. We are vulnerable. \\n\\nNow, all these countries (India, China, Russia, Brazil, some African Nations, ASEAN and others) noticed something crazy. \\n\\nUSA withdrew from Afghanistan back in 2021, without achieving anything. Trump is not in power. Joe Biden is. And it\'s not that Biden is good or Trump was good. It\'s the fact that Biden is so weak and sick that nobody in the US government cares to listen to him. The US built it\'s infrastructure in 1970s and 80s, but now it\'s falling apart. There\'s no money to replace it with better infrastructure. It\'s still good but it is declining. On top of that, US is giving billions in aid to Ukraine, rise in oil prices is hurting US citizens. Inflation is rising. Cost of living crisis is reaching new peaks. Young people are few. Old people are more. Borderline, US is overextended and declining. \\n\\nWho shall replace US? China? Look at china then. Crisis after crisis has been hitting them. Their covid policy was a disaster. They lost so many people that there\'s not enough demand for products now. Of course the official toll of deaths is fake. One child policy is hitting them hard. The Evergrande crisis was another crisis that exposed their weaknesses. On top of that, they were heavily dependent on selling to the west and using the western technology. Both have reduced. And the west has a policy of doing everything they can to reduce it further. \\n\\nSo what do countries do now? That\'s where the concept of BRICS currency comes in. BRICS is a group of five nations, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. With all due respect to Brazil and South Africa, Only India, China and Russia are important here. \\n\\nSo all these countries want to come together to make a new currency. This currency would only be used for international trade and would not be controlled by one single nation (like the dollar is controlled by one country i.e. US)\\n\\nBut more importantly, this currency would not be something that can be endlessly printed. It\'s value would be connected with some real commodity like gold, silver, copper, lithium etc. It could be a basket of multiple commodities. \\n\\nSounds good right? except it has problems. India and China don\'t trust each other. India and Russia are good but India want russia to stay away from china. Russia doesn\'t trust China either but have no other option except China. so there\'s a toxic relationship triangle here. It\'s very difficult for these countries to work together. \\n\\nBut, what is coming is some sort of commodity based currency. Whether BRICS make it or someone else makes it remains to be seen. \\n\\nMaking of this new currency is what some people call dedollarization, some call it decoupling. There are other names like system of systems collapse or financial reset. \\n\\nSo right now, as we have discussed, europe has an energy crisis thereby is in recession. China has internal economic problems and thereby not growing as it used to. America has unsustainable debt levels, among other problems explained above and hence economy is performing very poorly. \\n\\nThese poor performance means companies that are clients of companies that hire from Indian B schools are not performing well. Hence Companies are not hiring like they used to. \\n\\nWhy would the situation not improve within months? \\n\\nIn short, it is because the crisis has not hit it\'s peak yet. Things are yet to get bad. \\n\\nFor situations to get back to normal. What this means is, improvement in US economy, improvement in Europe\'s economy and improvement in Chinese economy. Let\'s have a look at these. \\n\\nAll these economies have one irreversible problem. That is, there are not enough young people. There\'s no solution for this problem. But let\'s assume this gets sorted somehow and look at other factors. \\n\\nLet\'s start with Europe. Europe needs cheap energy. Not in terms of oil, but liquified Gas. Cheap gas that would come from Russia has stopped. It has stopped because someone (allegations on US but not proved) illegally destroyed a pipeline that would send this gas. It would take at least a 5 to 7 years to rebuild that, assuming sanctions were removed today. \\n\\nBut let\'s assume they use ships to transfer this gas. Can be done as soon as sanctions are removed. But even it is not that easy. Removing Sanctions means it would create a situation where Russia can just attack a country in Europe and west would do nothing. This would break NATO, because if it can\'t deter Russia, what purpose does it serve?\\nTo come out of NATO, European nations would need to spend money on their defence if they want to feel secure. To spend this money, they need a good economy which needs cheap energy which again needs removal of sanctions and we are back to where we were. \\n\\nSo this establishes that Europe\'s economy is not going to improve anytime soon. It is doomed. \\n\\nLet\'s look at America now. Absolutely unsustainable levels of debt along with funding of two wars simultaneously as of now. China could open a third front anyday. What can America possibly do? well, they can simply end all the wars they are funding but can they?\\nIf they stop funding Ukraine or Israel, It would incentivise China to enter Vietnam/Philippines/Taiwan. It would incentivise Saudi Arabia to move closer to China and Russia. It would make europe feel they have been dumped, and hence europe would stop listening to USA. There\'s no way it goes positive for the united states. \\n\\nAnother thing they can do is to start manufacturing themselves instead of buying from China, but are they capable of it? Even if yes, it is not going to happen overnight. \\n\\nAnd none of these address the huge loans they have on themselves. On top of that, their president is Joe Biden. He is old and sick. He can\'t hold everyone together and lead in one direction. As of now, US is indecisive. There are elections in the United States in November 2024. Till then, things are not expected to move towards peace and stability. I don\'t know what would happen after elections. \\n\\nNext in our story is China. China has a problem with everyone around them and everyone not around them. But that\'s not new. Here\'s what is new. \\n\\nChinese politics works on a simple principle. Chinese government promises prosperity to it\'s citizens in lieu of their political freedom. There\'s a lot of dissent within China as of now. The economy is not doing well and Xi is under pressure. There is a possibility that Xi could use a war to distract people, and the USA\'s weak position is a good incentive. Young people are very few in number. They have a huge capacity to manufacture things but no one wants to buy. Their biggest customer is their enemy. Their second biggest customer is going broke. Access to Russia\'s resources amid sanctions has given a new lifeline to chinese economy. But this makes China survive, not thrive. They have done some geopolitical blunders and things look bleak for them. Infact yesterday, Uday Kotak (Kotak Mahindra Bank) tweeted about this. He mentioned the possibility of imploding of chinese economy as a wild card entry. \\n\\nTherefore, in a nutshell, structural, fundamental and irreversible problems in American, european and Chinese economy make it very less likely for the situation to improve within months. \\n\\nWhen would things improve then? \\n\\nThings would start to stabilize only after a commodity based currency comes into picture. The West would need to start manufacturing themselves. \\nEven if things happen as quickly as they have been happening in this decade, 2026 is the quickest I presume, because November 24 are US elections and policies would be very different based on who comes to power. \\n\\nIf you have read this far, you have read something twice the length of an aeon essay. So here\'s a bonus segment for you. \\n\\nShould I do an MBA right now? I\'m waiting for B school results/ I\'m Cat 24/25 Aspirant. \\n\\nI\'ll say, yes do it. Yes situation is bad and is not expected to improve. Yes you would need to take a huge loan. But things are going to get good for India, sooner or later. \\n\\nWhen all economies are falling like domino, all the rich people see this and they are investing in India. Recently Wall Street decided to pull out of china. Where do you think they will go? We are going to get billions and billions in FDI. Whenever this commodity based currency comes up, we are going to have a say in it. \\n\\nThe model of globalisation is here to stay and we have done Free Trade Agreements with a lot of countries recently. This is good news, because we are positioning ourselves as an alternative for china. \\n\\nHowever, we do have fundamental problems like a terrible judiciary, worthless education system and a rotting bureaucracy. Our infrastructure, despite recent growth, is absolutely shit as of now. But despite these, we are going to be in a good position, and you all would be able to earn good money if you put efforts. \\n\\nAll this tells you is, don\'t get relaxed just because you got into BLACKI. College can\'t feed you for life. Especially not in this economy. \\n\\nThe world right now is in a chaos. There is a literal game of thrones unfolding out here. But remember, Chaos is a ladder. \\n\\nLastly, I\'ll leave you my dialogue from that series. \\n\\nWhat do we say to the God of death? Not Today. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1c3nh8w/why_placement_scenario_is_bad_why_would_it_not/","datetime":"2024-04-14 12:36:55 IST","votes":719,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Discussion ",""],"archived":true},{"title":"advice for serious newbies","author":"ImportantPast1997","url":"https://reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1bz4kx5/advice_for_serious_newbies/","subreddit":"CATpreparation","body":"I can\u2019t sleep, so I\u2019m doing this, maybe some of you may find it useful. This is for anyone who is prepping for CAT 24, coming from someone who scored 99.69%lie in 2023. Feel free to ask any questions too lol\\n\\n1. There is no such thing as too much or too little time. The day u decide to pursue this exam is your start date, and that\u2019s it. I studied for three months and scored 99.69, some people studied for 8 months and scored 99.8, some people studied for a year and didn\u2019t cross the 99 mark. The amount of time spent studying does not correlate to your percentile in any way, what matters is consistency. \\n\\n2. The very first thing you do when you decide to pursue this, before you start studying, needs to be giving a full mock. A) it helps you figure out if you have any strengths that you can spend less time on studying. B) it prepares you for the idea of giving an exam with negative marking (a first for most humanities and commerce students). C) it makes the exam seem a lot more real, and actually makes u start working like a dog. D) you realise that a lot of questions are actually doable even with zero studying. It\u2019s just a matter of filtering through the paper and finding them.\\n\\n3. Question selection and time management is all this exam is about. You cannot, CANNOT, afford to mark answers for questions you don\u2019t know the answer to. You have to be absolutely sure of the answers. the CAT paper isn\u2019t difficult. In fact if you sit with it with no time constraint you will find upwards of 20 questions to be completely doable. The problem is that they may either be a) difficult to find amid all the questions or b) difficult to recognise that they\u2019re easy to solve unless u actually start solving them. So you\u2019re not trying to learn all of math. you\u2019re trying to develop the skill to identify these solvable questions.\\n\\n4. Something I\u2019m noticing a lot of people on this sub do is they\u2019re aiming for percentiles, judging their prep on the basis of the percentiles they\u2019re scoring in mocks. my advice is: forget the percentile entirely. Focus on the marks. 99.5 percentile is associated with about 50% marks (even in previous years when the total number of questions in the paper was higher). Aim for that, ie score around 90-100. Percentile is not a good measure of progress, it\u2019s very deceiving. To score 90-100 marks you want to score roughly 30 marks in each section (assuming the paper pattern doesn\u2019t change), which means you need to do about 10 questions per section. You can get away with doing 4-5 questions to clear sectional cutoffs if any one section is particularly weak, and compensate for that by doing more in your strong sections. prep accordingly.\\n\\n5. Do not underestimate the value of mocks, sections and past year papers. \\n\\n\\n","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1bz4kx5/advice_for_serious_newbies/","datetime":"2024-04-08 23:27:32 IST","votes":47,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Words of Wisdom ",""],"archived":true},{"title":"For Those done With PI: Looking for Guidance for B-school","author":"[deleted]","url":"https://reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1byzan9/for_those_done_with_pi_looking_for_guidance_for/","subreddit":"CATpreparation","body":"Here are my suggestions on what to do\\n\\n1.

Prepare well for your placements. If you don\'t have workex, do some internships, or whatever you can to fill up your CV with keywords before you join your MBA. Everything is all fun and happiness in those 2 years, but if you don\'t end up with a good job, many of us won\'t look at those times with affection.\\n\\n\\n \\n2. Even if you don\'t have a profile good enough for getting into consulting, still prepare case studies and guesstimates. They for sure will increase your knowledge, structure your thinking and teach you excellent verbalisation of your thoughts. Read Case in Point till page 100.\\n\\n\\n  \\n3. Don\'t join your MBA without a good Master CV and having all the failures, achievements, learnings, PORs and impact of whatever you\'ve done in your grad, school, personal life, workex and internships. This will save you 10x efforts while preparing your CV and batch profile as well as you\'ll already have answers to 80% of the HR questions.\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Shortlists for summers and finals are a very random process. So don\'t get disheartened of all your homies and girls get good shortlists but you don\'t. You\'ll soon get one too. All you can do is prepare a good CV and then hope for the best. You CANNOT target a shortlist. That\'s not how it works. However if you are fixated on a company, you can do your fucking absolute best in its case competition and get a PPI. \\n\\n\\n\\n5. Unless you want to get in the Dean\'s merit list or something, MBA grades don\'t really matter. Just don\'t fail anything. Anything above 7.5 is okay\\n\\n\\n\\n6. The people around you decide what kind of 2 years you\'ll have. Trust me, you become an average of the people you spend your time most with. So find out good people and stick to them. \\n  \\n\\n\\n7. Be kind and polite and do a couple of things for those around you. Create a sense of reciprocity.  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n8. If the golden rule is \\"Do to people what you\'d like to be done to you\\" then the platinum rule is that \\"Do to people what they\'d like to be done to them\\".\\n \\n\\n\\n9. Be respectful and talk well to people. Looks for sure matter, but not as much as we think they do and they\'re just an entry level criteria. \\n  \\n\\n\\n10. MBA is that time when you may or may not have money, but you have all the freedom you want. Make good use of it. \\n\\n\\n\\n11. About s*x, I know a lot of us go into BSchools hoping that we\'d get a lot of it. True, you can get a lot of it, given you look somewhat decent and have a good personality. However the irony is that after you do get a lot of casual s*x, you\'ll realise that casual s*x is not what you want. S*x as a form of communicating the love you have for someone is everything you need.  \\n \\n\\n\\n12. Relationships. Be clear about what you want: whether its something serious or casual or whether you don\'t have clarity. Be honest and communicate this to the potential partners you might be having. I\'ve seen people giving false commitments and then withdrawing, leaving the other person broken beyond repair. Do not cheat. Don\'t hurt anyone, because trust me, when the hurt person has the last laugh, you\'ll be walking out of college with 0 credibility and respect. Have seen this happening very recently in my BSchool. Remember: DO NOT SH*T WHERE YOU EAT.   \\n\\n\\n\\n13. Draw clear boundaries with people, and stick to them. What makes you uncomfortable, communicate about it. \\n \\n\\n\\n14. Have a healthy relationship with alcohol, smoking and all other stuff. I know a lot of parties do happen and a lot of such stuff happens in them, but don\'t over abuse it. Alcohol fu*ks you up by fu*king up your health, your relationships and everything. A very close friend of my ex, who were IIM passouts in 2022 was engaged in multiple casual relationships at the institute, heavily drank, smoked and smoked up. Last year, she tried to kill herself by popping some pills. We saved her, but this is what overdoing things can lead to. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n15. Not everyone is worth the effort. You\'ll find some people who are extremely selfish and will take a lot from you, but show their true colours when it becomes inconvenient for them. They will have 0 reciprocity. Instead of wasting your time on such people, focus on the ones you want to keep forever. However DO NOT burn your bridges.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n16. People won\'t remember you for the gpa you got or the placement you got. They\'ll remember you for how you made them feel. So be a good person, be kind and very polite. Create a sense of debt in people. You never know which company you might want to get referred to in the future :)  \\n \\n\\n\\n17. Your health is extremely important: both mental and physical. Visit your campus therapist and keep exercising. Keep your room pleasent and clean. \\n  \\n\\n\\n18. Be very clear about money. It is the biggest factor that spoils relationships. Make splitwise your best friend. Talk to your circle and decide whether you\'ll be adding the 18 rupees sutta, 20 rupees coffee, 50 rupees auto kind of expenses to your splitwise. Because with time, the law of averages catches up and you all end up spending more or less equally on these miscellaneous expenses. But if only 1 or 2 people pay all the time, the amount unaccounted for can  reach in 10000s by the end of 2 years. So be clear about this.\\n\\n\\n\\n19. Use the CATS principle: Compliment, appreciate, thank, sorry. People who speak well do get an unfair advantage. Also, the quality of your network matters, not the quantity. \\n\\n\\n\\n20. Learn about your summer internship company and if you do want to continue full time with it, give your best for a PPO. A PPO makes your second year extremely chill. Remember, getting a PPO is more about how you gel with your boss and the team. So be polite and respectful there as well. You may or may not achieve all your deliverables in the project, but what kind of relationship you had with the coworkers plays a large part in getting a PPO. The organisation where I was working at gave PPOs to 10 out of 13 people from by BSchool. The other 3 people had arguments a few times with their managers.  \\n\\n\\n\\n21. Get out of your comfort zone or your MBA will be just another 2 years of your life. A moment outside the comfort zone leads to a story for life. I took that leap of faith and now I\'m a completely different person than what I was when I joined. \\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, be humble, respect everyone and gaand faad maje karo. You\'ll never have such kind of resources to spend ever again (one or \\nmore out of money, time, energy). \\nAll the very best \ud83d\udcaf\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9e\ud83e\uddff\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nP.S: Other people are welcome to add their own suggestions   \\n\\n\\nAddition 1: Even in the best BSchools, there are always a few kids who struggle to get shortlists initially and get depressed. For 95% of the new batch, there is a tight slap that brings them back to reality from the bubble of getting into a top institute, and that is summers. If CAT XAT prep is 10, GD PI WAT prep is 100 then placement prep is 150. However I\'ll say it again. Don\'t dwell too much on shortlists. Keep doing your preparation. Me, with a 9/6/8 profile got shortlists of companies paying 3-4 lac+ stipends and got into one of those. I was shit scared when I didn\'t get shortlists considering my 6 and low workex and thought anything with a stipend of 50000 would be good. \\n\\nAddition 2: Tell your grad profs, ex bosses at work and internships that you\'ll be seeking their approval for some CV points. If your BSchool just requires the domain of your ex company in the approval email, try to get your good friends/ ex colleagues at work to approve your points. That way thoda badha chadha bhi sakte ho, but don\'t lie and exaggerate so much that you won\'t be able to defend it if asked about it in interviews. Also stay on good terms with your boss so that they approve your points without too much of scrutiny in case your BSchool allows approvals only from your managers. \\n\\nAddition 3: Use that Coursera/ udemy your company provides you before you join MBA to complete some courses in domains you like. They will add good keywords to your CV. \\n \\n\\n\\nAddition 4: Making your CV is the toughest task you\'ll experience. You\'ll have to keep it within one page, limit a point to one line, add action verbs, keywords numbers and impact all in one line. Also you\'ll need to make CVs for different domains (marketing, finance, general, prodman, etc). So go to your college armed with a detailed Master CV. And show your CV points to many seniors, super seniors and make them absolutely sharp and crisp. \\n\\nAddition 5: Use gestures as much as possible. Get your friends some homemade food, write your closest friend a note on how much they mean to you, or order some waffles for your roommate, take an ill friend to the hospital. On the last day of my summer internship, I bought 15-20 dairy milks worth 10 rupees and gave it to my managers, the HRs who handled us interns, my HRBP and other members of the team as a thank you. All of them got so so happy, I can\'t tell you. It felt like they were kids in a birthday party who got a large chocolate and a set of stationery as a return gift. Such gestures go a very long way and people WILL remember you very fondly for it, for all their lives and help you whenever needed for sure. \\n\\nP.S: **I\'ll soon do another \\"2 cents\\" post for all CAT and OMET aspirants here related to exam and gdpi prep. I actually wrote this \\"2 cents\\" for the ones who\'ve or will convert a BSchool and join this year, but I\'m amazed at how such kind of a post also ended up giving some motivation to those who are yet to give CAT and OMETs.**\\n\\nAlso, thank you for showing so much love to the post. I hope this inspires you all to work hard and get into the best BSchools :) \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9e\\n\\n","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1bx1e94/my_2_cents_to_people_joining_their_mba/","datetime":"2024-04-06 08:49:01 IST","votes":1005,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Words of Wisdom ",""],"archived":true},{"title":"I am a former Meta/Google recruiter.

I have seen many posts on here where someone posts about how they are not getting hired, and people respond by saying their resume is not good enough and that\'s why they are not hearing back. And that you should spend lots of time tailoring resumes to jobs. I have looked at these resumes, 98% of these resumes are completely fine. I think people here heavily overestimate how carefully recruiters judge resumes. I never even read most of the resume, just skim for the information I need.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs a high volume recruiter working at big companies, you do not have time to spend lots of time on resumes. You are looking at hundreds a week and recruiters are generally pretty busy with other stuff like responding to candidates, attending prescreens with candidates, attending calls with hiring teams, and organizing. All they look at is your experience/skills directly relevant to the job, your work experience, and the type of companies you are working for. They are not spending time looking at formatting, analyzing wording, analyzing experience for more than 1 minute, often even less than 30 seconds. Its a numbers game for recruiters they are trying to get through as many as they can.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nYou are much better served with your time applying to jobs at a high volume than tailoring resumes to jobs. Right now in this market, the resumes that get looked at is a lot of luck. I look at the first 200 or so on a given job posting, the rest just end up applying too late and never get looked at. You are better served being the first to apply than to heavily tailor for given jobs.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAlso another interesting thing I have learned with my 10 years of recruiting experience is that to never discount resumes that look like the person has not spent a lot of time on it. I have found some of my best candidates among people with just one or two lines for each job they have worked at, and their tech stack. Lot of very good engineering talent is cocky about their experience especially if they have worked at good companies, and they do not feel they need to spend time on their resumes. Its foolish as recruiter to discount these people just because they think spending time on resumes is useless or they are too cool to do it. Cocky is not a bad trait if you can back it up and hiring managers understand this as well.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTLDR: Making perfect resumes is highly overrated, recruiters do not look at it in a lot of detail, and you are better served applying in heavy volume and aiming to be some of the first people to apply.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bq2gu7/i_am_a_former_metagoogle_recruiter_i_think_lot_of/","datetime":"2024-03-28 23:44:52 IST","votes":4431,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"Modern straight man is also a victim of PATRIARCHY and I will tell you HOW","author":"[deleted]","url":"https://reddit.com/r/onexindia/comments/1bmgaxl/modern_straight_man_is_also_a_victim_of/","subreddit":"onexindia","body":"So, I talk with alot of men. I am gay, ofcourse. I flirt with straight men, gay men, bi men, have dozens of female friends and I do think I have reached an understanding - how we all are victims of patriarchy (this social system) and how we (the children of future/present) are paying the debts of past.\\n\\nThere are three basic problems, men have generally  and on this sub reddit you can also find -\\n\\n1. Sexually frustrated - no female interaction, no sex till 26-28 while Western society start it at 14/15 and then so much control, taboofication of porn, masturbation and even thoughts about sex and then lack of sex education, confusion about size, stamina, imposition of guilt, etc, all comes under this umbrella (Argument 1 or A1 ) I will call it \\n\\n2. Economic Burden - We are men, we need a job, we need to make our houses, look after our kids, look after our dogs, look after our old parents, look after if gutter in front of our house gets fixed, its a man\'s world and we pay the price so we earn money to pay it. Schooling, College, Job, Marriage and Death. 8-5 job, 26 days a week and managing finances. Its such a burden na ?\\n\\n3. Ideal Man Image - I should be manly enough, I cant have a soft voice ( even if its how God made me), I cant have thin arms, I need to grow beard yaar, my feet are too small, my dick is too small, are my balls even making semen ? I am dark....I am balding, I have small neck, what to do ? I am shorter than 5\'4, I am not manly enough, I dont walk like a man, I might be into men, trans turns me on but I cant express it. (also called as Toxic Masculinity) \\n\\n\\nNow, I will refute each one of them. Dont hate me, I wont argue much, take it as my opinion.\\n\\n\\n1. First issue which each straight man faces is sex nahi milta yaar. How will you get sex when the society your ancestors created have  tried to control every aspect of sexuality of women ? You put women behind veils, you control when she marries, who she marries, you create concept of dowry, you give utmost importance to virginity and rejects non virgin women as prostitute, then you even make prostitution a taboo and prosecute them and treat them as lowly, push them outside society and then you expect - tumko sex miljaye ? \\n\\nHere many men say - we only want a virgin girl for sex but same men go and lurk on women profiles for sex ? How ? Here there must be many fathers, many brothers or just witness of society - how society control women, even her basic decisions are taken by father and brother. \\n\\nMen in India are so sexually frustrated - they are not getting release, saara din dimaag mai ye chalta hai, girl friend kaise bane, girl friend bane toh sex karu magar bhai, women are 50% of population, and if men are out there, why are not women ? Because they are being controlled and demonified by patriarchal society. First thing. Argument refuted.\\n\\n\\n2. I will support second argument. See, money is what runs and control society and when you limit the money and capital  you can control someone more easily. Thats what men did - they controlled econimic venturing of women except gharelu udyog. If you see, the tribal and SC communities where women worl equally as men, there is less burden on men and they run families more efficiently. But in upper castes society and especially varniks, women were kept behind doors and when this translated to present time - when life was tough, needs more and money difficult to earn- all burden fell on male members pushing them to depression, self loathing and suicides. Women are not responsibility of men but they became because society wanted to control them.There are many men who even today on this sub reddit or elsewhere oppose women getting jobs and all but believe me in long run it will help you and liberate and open up society.\\n\\n(you can say due to Islamic invasions, blah blah but there were many Hindu Kingdoms since forever who stayed independent from Islamic clutches)\\n\\n3. Third is image of men, what is ideal man ? Ideal man is like some demigod, maybe Indra but what about those men who are short, not as handsome , not as manly, maybe gay, maybe feminine, maybe softly voiced or shorter dick, tu woh sab kaha jayenge ? This is self imposed guilt and pressur which is imposed by society itself. And it is because, a man is considered head of family, religion, culture and society - and he has to present an image.\\n\\nWithin straight men there is heirarchy, some men are superior in looks, intelligence and pedigree while some are inferior and others are mediocre, some are rich and others are poor therefore, while patriarchal norms suit the superior ones, the inferior ones (which are 75%) are pushed to further depression and suicides.\\n\\nTherefore, Patriarchy, Toxic Masclunity is your enemy, not friend.

Mocks: give a lot of mocks, doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re done with the syllabus or not, truth is, you\u2019ll never be done with the syllabus, giving mocks and revising the same constantly is a good practice, if you\u2019re busy, give mocks on the last day of the mock, post which answers are released so you can review it right away, don\u2019t wait too long to review the mocks, you\u2019ll probably forget the reasoning for your answers. \\n\\n2. Coaching- don\u2019t take it unless you know the guy teaching you is a great teacher or a cat 99+ percentiler himself, most of the coaching faculty at IMS/Cl/Time are part time and aren\u2019t really qualified to teach, they won\u2019t be able to answer the doubts you have, better to google and YouTube\\n\\n3. Colleges- don\u2019t think about it right now, your main aim should be to get a high percentile, two likely outcomes are going to happen, either you find out you\u2019re going to get your dream college at a low percentile hence you get lax or you find out even a 99.5+ isn\u2019t sufficient to get the college you\u2019re after, both don\u2019t contribute to your journey\\n\\n4. Mock review: if you don\u2019t have friends who are writing CAT (I didn\u2019t), this subs perfect, post every simcat/aimcat/cdc a discussion happens on this sub which makes you motivated for the next attempt, either someone scores higher than your best attempt fueling your motivation or scores lower than your worst attempt letting you know you aren\u2019t alone in the journey\\n\\n5. Mock fluctuations: it\u2019s normal for your scores to fluctuate, don\u2019t take too much bt, my own mock scores have fluctuated from a 75 to 99.98 percentile. It happens \\n\\n6. VARC Section: key to acing it is reading with intent I.e. trying to decipher what the author is saying, the only way you can get better at it is by reading a lot of RCs you aren\u2019t comfortable reading, try aeon essays for the same. Its amazing\\n\\n7. DILR - the only way you get good at puzzles is by solving a lot of it, solve as many DILR sets as you can\\n\\n8. Past papers: solve past papers (2020-2023) as mock tests, they\u2019re the best indicators of where you stand, sometimes you won\u2019t feel that the VARC section answers by the IMS/TIME/CL are right, however you won\u2019t be able to argue with the actual exam setter\\n\\n9. Qa: shouldn\u2019t comment as this is where I scored my lowest, however, solve all past papers, many question in cat are repeated (similar logic) will help you out\\n\\nEdit: credit to u/lonerenginner for this point \\n\\n10. Social media (r/catpreparation etc):  Apart from this , I would also like to emphasize that engaging in debates here may not yield fruitful outcomes and could potentially consume a significant amount of your time.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, comment on here, I\u2019ll try answering most, off for now.

Best time to make connections, show your capabilities and multitasking skills. But if it\'s not happening, don\'t lose hope and just hang-in there. \\n\\n\\n2. Keep your priorities clear, batch toppers do get preference in some companies but not in all of them. If you want to focus on academics, start from Day-1, this ain\'t your UG where you can have a character development arc in middle of the college. \\n\\n\\n3. On the same lines, if you think your CV is not upto the mark, start working on it immediately. Work on case comps, go for clubs/committee positions in your college, do relevant certifications. \\n\\n\\n4. Emotions are very important, and this is like your social currency, spend it on right people and you will see returns till the end of your life. Choose your friends wisely, and don\'t make enemies and shit. \\n\\n\\n5. Don\'t do glocal, if you can\'t sustain that shit emotionally, it takes a toll on your memtal being. And even if you are an iota of a decent human being, you will start feeling guilty and that will snowball into something much much worse. \\n\\n\\n6. Always be calm and keep your emotions(read:anger) in check. Don\'t mess with profs at all. On the same lines, don\'t just do anything that might hamper your chances in the future. \\n\\n\\n7. Always be helpful to everyone, almost all of the people here form their own groups, and stay loyal to them only, but you know the other 98 percent of the batch is also as talented as your group is, so a bit of socialising with them will not hurt you and you never know that particular guy might be the onw giving you referral for your dream company in future. \\n\\n\\n8.

Long story. \\n\\nMy brother got married 2 years ago, it was an arranged marriage. Members of our house are mom, dad, brother, his wife and myself. Before the wedding my SIL was not sure of staying in joint family but my brother assured her that he will make sure she lives comfortably. \\n\\nThen he slowly started to have the \u2018talk\u2019 with our parents. He explained to them that if they are expecting the bahu to stay in their house happily, the only way is to make her feel home, and it is not just in-laws responsibility but his own responsibility as well. He told them that making her feel at home means we should all respect each other\u2019s boundaries, not poking nose in each other\u2019s business (my parents expect us to tell them everything we do, everywhere we go). Also told them that she is a grown woman with her own personality and opinions, you can\u2019t expect her to change overnight or change at all. Just respect her opinions. \\n\\nHe also told the exact same things to his then to-be wife. He told her that parents will obviously be conservative and it is difficult for them to change at this age, asked her to be respectful of their opinions. He assured her that nobody will poke their nose in her business.\\n\\nInitially my parents were reluctant because they\u2019re typical indian parents, they don\u2019t understand personal space. But after repeated conversations, they did put effort to give my SIL her own space. They didn\u2019t ask her where she is going, didn\u2019t ask her to wear certain type of clothes, didn\u2019t expect her to cook for the entire family (usually mom cooks and dad helps her after his retirement. My SIL also started helping them, so I started to help too lol). All other chores like laundry and room cleaning would be done as per individual convenience. \\n\\nThey did have argument about my SIL not wearing mangalsutra all the time. She wears it only when going to functions or pooja etc which my mom didn\u2019t like. Ultimately mom said \u201cits ok beta, whatever makes you happy\u201d. Mom told me later that she remembered all those points my brother had told before. SIL was so moved by it that she got a different design stylish mangalsutra and wears it pretty much evey day now out of her own will \ud83e\udd7a\\n\\nI also see my SIL and mom-dad defend each other when neighbour aunties or relatives try to taunt something, even in the absence of the other. It is wholesome to see their bond. They are not super close. But they have a respectful relationship. \\n\\nWhenever relatives try to taunt, I cannot believe my conservative parents have learnt to say \u201clet the kids fly, let them do whatever they want. We know we have raised them right, we know that they will not cross the moral boundary. So there is nothing for us to micromanage or worry about. We are enjoying retirement\u201d. It definitely took a lot of effort, assurance and maintaining the trust to bring this change in my parents but it is worth it. Thanks for reading.\\n\\nEdit: thanks everyone for your kind words and best wishes \ud83e\udd70 many of our parents don\u2019t know any better because they were also raised/have lived in toxic environment.

Rohan dumps her and blocks her the next day - Ahana goes to his birthday, lashes out at him, tells his current girlfriend he cheated on her with Ahana, and her friend breaks Rohan\u2019s nose.

I finally dug through the old training manual I had created and now I remember - Ambulance billing SHOULD work the same as those below as far as disputes etc.. The exception that I remembered was: the reason people were going into collections CONSTANTLY for ambulance visits, was because ambulance billing is different. They send the check for the ambulance amount to the patient directly, so the patient will pay the ambulance bill - and then the patients would cash that check, and never pay the ambulance bill, and then get put into collections. As far as insurance was concerned, they DID pay the ambulance bill and it\'s not their problem. But the ambulance company never saw the $ because the patient would spend it. So - before you cash a check, make sure it\'s really supposed to be kept by you.  \\n\\n I got looped into a thread about medical collections that started with a very inaccurate \\"tip,\\" and saw that there was a FREAKING TON of misinformation floating around about what to do when you have medical debt.\\n\\nSo I thought I\'d share the knowledge that I have on the topic from a few years as a trainer in a medical billing & collections agency.\\n\\n**Disclaimer**: I worked for one agency that had multiple sites nationwide in the US. I am not a lawyer, I am NOT giving legal advice. I am just sharing what I know from a few years in the industry including a competitor study that we did to find out how our competitors handle the same situations. I will not share the name of the company I worked for; they were most definitely shady in some areas and I am not looking to dox myself either. If anyone has more knowledge than me on the topic, please chime in. I am also not looking for a \\"Healthcare in the US is broken\\" because yeah no shit Sherlock; this isn\'t the thread where we can fix that. Oh also I will swear sometimes in this post.\\n\\nIf you have medical debt, these tips may help you to negotiate down or get the debt written off, or to ignore bad advice from people telling you to do something that could have negative repercussions. I\'ll say \\"hospitals\\" below but this encompasses all medical providers as far as my experience goes.\\n\\n***OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS:***\\n\\n**Your debt goes in stages:**\\n\\n* Early Out - debt is still owned and usually managed by hospital; may be outsourced to an agency. This is the stage where they can fix any insurance issues as well so **call as soon as you get the bill before it goes into collections**! They\'re nice when it\'s still in Early Out; they have to be aggressive when it goes into collections. Some hospitals send their bills from EO to Bad Debt in 30 days; some wait years. So call right away when you get a bill because there\'s no way to know their timeline. Oftentimes if the amount is low, they will just write it off or take a small payment in the EBO stage. They will work with you. Once it hits Bad Debt aka Collections, the options can be limited. Additionally, the GENERAL rule in health insurance is that you have to resolve the claim within 1 year. Medicaid/Medicare/Tricare had different rules, but in general - getting your insurance to pay after 1 year is not going to happen. CALL WHEN YOU GET THE BILL!\\n* Bad Debt **Contractors** \\\\- still owned by hospital but using collection agency for the work\\n* Bad Debt **Purchasers** \\\\- sold off to very aggressive collection agency who has little hope to recover the debt.\\n\\nThere are 2 types of med collection agencies - I don\'t know if there\'s an official term for each type, but I\'ll make up my own.\\n\\n* **Contract** \\\\- the kind that I worked for, that has an active contract with the hospital and gets a small % of the collected amount.\\n* And **Purchasers** \\\\- the kind that purchases the debts in bulk at a discount and tries to recoup that money and more from you. Facilities usually go through **Contract** agencies before **Purchaser** agencies.\\n\\n***COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:***\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #1: Your medical debt cannot go to collections because it\'s medical debt.**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Yeah, right. I wish this was true. However, without the collections world, hospitals would close - so it\'s a reality with our current healthcare system. Know that if you were insured and didn\'t pay your portion, or if you didn\'t have insurance AND didn\'t attempt to get state coverage that would cover those bills, OR were turned down for state insurance....the debt usually lies on your shoulders. They can reduce it, do payment plans, etc. but they can absolutely put you in collections for your car accident, and they will often be forced to do so.\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #2: Medical debt cannot have any long-lasting affects on my credit or property.**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Falsity false, boys. It sure can. The only reason a hospital may not choose to report to the credit bureaus, seize property, or go after your income is usually because it makes them look bad to the community and it\'s expensive to do the above. But they can and do report to credit if they choose to. Oftentimes it\'s the last resort after a certain time frame, but \\"Sir, this can affect your credit score if not paid\\" can be the last option they can use in order to get payment from repeat offenders or low-income areas where the hospital faces a risk of closing if old debts aren\'t resolved - hospitals have bills to pay too, y\'all. At my facility less than 10% of our providers reported to credit, but many still did and it\'s common.\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #3: Just telling the agency that you want an itemized bill will close out the debt.**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Oh god, false but **COMMONLY** spread misconception. Per FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act), it has to pause the collection process (stopping it from reporting to credit & stopping phone calls while they order it from the hospital), but that may be all it does. Once the IB is sent, collection can continue.\\n\\nOn rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don\'t go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don\'t expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved.\\n\\nIf it\'s a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn\'t worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we\'d always send it if we couldn\'t convince the client to pay in installments. It\'s worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments.\\n\\nYou should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your \'proof of debt\' because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won\'t list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt.\\n\\nThat\'s not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don\'t want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it!\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they\'ve got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Bitch, please. They know it\'s yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn\'t they? The only thing you\'re doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you.\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights**  \\nor  \\n**Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn\'t authorize them to collect the debt, and they\'re violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They\'re not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn\'t know why you went.\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don\'t report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There\'s no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don\'t report to credit on THIS account, if we didn\'t. But then we\'d give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don\'t assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages.\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can\'t call/write/etc you, that doesn\'t stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt.\\n\\nIt also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you\'re cutting off your nose to spite your face.\\n\\nNow, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom\'s car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility\'s network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is).\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it\'s you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they\'re calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it\'s your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it\'s name/address/year of birth. The agency\'s lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what\'s on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it\'s for your protection.\\n\\nYou can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state \\"collections\\" on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep\'s name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don\'t know if they\'re legit. If they are legit, they\'ll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they\'ll resend a letter if you tell them you\'ll pay, etc.\\n\\nLook up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it\'s a scam. That\'s the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man).\\n\\n* **MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!**\\n\\n\\\\--\x3e *Maaaaybe*. We asked for the lawyer\'s contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it\'s not foolproof.\\n\\nIf the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen.\\n\\nIf you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we\'re not going to call back...but that doesn\'t always stop the process.\\n\\nI don\'t know the time frame on that because I wasn\'t in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit.\\n\\n**LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:**\\n\\n* ***You have to go through us to pay this debt.*** This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It\'s always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay.\\n* ***I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.*** Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill. Their boss is going to mad if they take a low payment amount on a big debt. But they absolutely can take your payment of whatever amount you\'d like. That being said, it doesn\'t automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you\'re making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case.\\n* ***\\"This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.\\"*** Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you\'re in collections. Like, duh.  \\nThey are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don\'t miss a payment. But don\'t think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they\'re more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them.\\n\\n**MAGIC WORD:**  \\n**I DISPUTE the validity of this debt**. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt. The agency should ask the reason for the dispute, but you do not have to provide it. They will then kick out an itemized bill to prove the validity of the debt. However - oftentimes if there was a dispute, we just closed out the debt altogether and were done, with zero negative consequences. I used to teach my agents how to tell the difference between a real dispute vs. a fake dispute, but in reality **if the D-word is said, it\'s a dispute.**\\n\\nGood, valid, morally and ethically positive reasons to dispute a debt: I didn\'t receive that service, the appointment was canceled, I never got a bill in the first place, someone else was supposed to pay (divorce or car accident), identify fraud, I was injured during this procedure.\\n\\nBullshit reasons to dispute: The doctor was mean, I\'m racist and the doctor was X ethnicity, I don\'t want to pay, my insurance should have paid this.\\n\\nBut again if you say **DISPUTE** \\\\- they can ask more questions to see if it\'s a real dispute, but ultimately you CAN sue them if you tell them you\'re disputing it and they don\'t immediately pause reporting to credit while they investigate.\\n\\n**THINGS YOU CAN THEORETICALLY SUE THE AGENCY OVER:**  \\n\\\\-If you say dispute and they don\'t stop credit reporting to investigate - HUGE no-no; report per FDCPA.  \\n\\\\-If they give out your health information to someone who was not confirmed to be you, per their verification process. HUGE no-no; report per HIPAA.  \\n\\\\-If they say it\'s a **debt** before confirming it\'s you that they have on the line - FDCPA violation, do not pass go.\\n\\n**What to do on every medical collections call:**  \\n\\\\-Get the name of the agency and the representative you\'re speaking with; write down date and time. This may be needed in the future if they break FDCPA or HIPAA; it can also help with disputes or conversations with management later on.  \\n\\\\-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it\'s a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system?  \\n\\\\-Ask what happened with your insurance. How much did my insurance pay, did they say why this amount was left over?  \\n\\\\-Call your insurance to see what happened if the agency isn\'t clear. There is a possibility that it can be re-billed even after it\'s in Bad Debt.  \\n\\\\-Be friendly and polite. Agents have a good bit of freedom to grant discounts and set up comfortable payment plans, and they\'ll only use those kindnesses if you\'re not a douche.  \\nAlso, they\'re humans too, probably making $2 above minimum wage, and the job is really tough because people are mean and have heartbreaking stories. Be human. It helps.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/hr6ccy/ulpt_how_to_dispute_medical_debt_the_right/","datetime":"2020-07-14 23:26:17 IST","votes":28640,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"[OC] Trending Google Searches by State Between 2018 and 2020","author":"V1Analytics","url":"https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/hs9mnz/oc_trending_google_searches_by_state_between_2018/","subreddit":"dataisbeautiful","body":"","media":"https://v.redd.it/l0rvdugoy7b51","datetime":"2020-07-16 18:57:25 IST","votes":162709,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"LPT: You can easily download all of your Facebook content and finally leave the service.","author":"TheyCallMeDrAsshole","url":"https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/hv6fjc/lpt_you_can_easily_download_all_of_your_facebook/","subreddit":"LifeProTips","body":"If you are concerned about losing all of your content, you can go to:\\n\\nSettings -> Your Facebook Information -> Download Your Information\\n\\nEdit: Yes, this includes all of your photos","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/hv6fjc/lpt_you_can_easily_download_all_of_your_facebook/","datetime":"2020-07-21 17:54:44 IST","votes":32577,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Social"],"archived":false},{"title":"LPT: If you have a lot of free time at the moment, you can generate a little income on the side by doing online work like teaching english, transcription, microtasks or surveys.

You have to earn \xa333 per day in order to hit the \xa31000 per month mark, which is very doable when you have 20 or so sites to work with.\\n\\nFor me at the moment it\'s usually a one hour class which makes me \xa315 and then a combination of projects from Lionsbridge (which currently pays about $15 dollars for an hour) and then a couple of random short tasks or surveys from one of the other sites, or more if I don\'t do a class...Takes a while to fine tune it and I\'m always modifying the combination but believe me it\'s more than doable. As I say, you just need to hit that \xa333 a day, which is actually even easier to hit in dollars if you prefer to think of it that way.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, and this is only useful to people in the UK, I am currently doing \\"Matched Betting\\" because the Premier league is on now and more and more sporting fixtures are making a comeback. Match betting is where you bet on one outcome in the bookies and then bet against that outcome in the exchange, with both bets at almost the same odds.\\n\\nSo for example, If you bet \xa310 for Real Madrid to win at odds of 2.5 on the betting site, and then bet for Real Madrid not to win(i.e bet against them) on the exchange at the same odds, you are covered in all outcomes, win lose or draw.\\n\\nThis means you have fullfilled the requirements of the betting sites offer (for example, Bet \xa310 and get \xa340 in free bets) without actually gambling, since there is no risk of losing the \xa310 you bet since it\'s matched. You then do the exact same thing with your \xa340 free bets, and this is where you make the profit since you\'re not using \xa340 of your own money.\\n\\nYes It\'s totally legal, just a loophole in the system really, although I was very suspicious of it at first. I wrote a guide explaining how to do it, you can find it at the top of my profile if you are interested. I have made about \xa3700-\xa3800 per month from doing this, on top of the money from other sites, but obviously this means putting in more time!\\n\\nI hope this is of some help, If you have any other questions don\'t hesitate to ask!","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/har8qo/lpt_if_you_have_a_lot_of_free_time_at_the_moment/","datetime":"2020-06-17 19:05:58 IST","votes":8133,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Productivity"],"archived":false},{"title":"Data from 1 Year of Applying for Software Engineering Jobs","author":"resumethrowaway99009","url":"https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hz5a81/data_from_1_year_of_applying_for_software/","subreddit":"cscareerquestions","body":"#**Intro**\\n\\nI\'m a recent Computer Science graduate from a public university in California. The reason I started studying CS was to become a Software Engineer. I had dreams of working at FAANG and at the time I didn\'t realize how foolish that was. As I got closer to graduating and started to apply for internships and jobs I began to realize how competitive the field was. I was a middle-of-the-pack CS student at public university. I never had a shot at FAANG.\\n\\nI was originally set to graduate in December 2019, but decided to take an extra semester and graduate in the spring because I could not find a Software Engineering job. That turned out to be a mistake because I graduated during the peak of Covid-19. I officially graduated in May. I have applied to over 700 positions since July 27th, 2019. I am currently unemployed.\\n\\nI decided to keep track of all my job applications because I knew I would have to apply to a lot of positions and I needed a way to organize them.\\n\\nI\'m posting now as a postmortem to my Software Engineering job search. Hopefully you can learn something from this, and if not maybe it will at least be entertaining.\\n\\n#**Data**\\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_7pS1LQ_aF_AbCm-7CHOZ4EAmnf1c7TmQVqw7m0f53I/edit?usp=sharing) is the raw data I collected. [Here](https://imgur.com/fVgorm6) is a pie chart breakdown of the outcomes.\\n\\n\\nI kept track of: The company name, the position title, the position location, the date that I applied on, the final outcome, whether or not I got an interview, and the platform on which I applied. \\n\\nLooking back I should have kept track on the date of rejection to figure out the average time it takes to get a response. There are probably other useful data points I could\'ve collected to. Let me know if you have any thoughts on this.\\n\\n#**Resume & Cover Letter**\\n\\nI\'ve made many changes to my resume over the course of the year. I\'ll post a few different versions here, though this is not an exhaustive list. \\n\\n[V1](https://imgur.com/FluOaoc)\\n\\n[V2](https://imgur.com/PASQ7ne)\\n\\n[Current Resume](https://imgur.com/Zw8DAQg)\\n\\nThere hasn\'t been any increase in responses to my resume as I\'ve changed it. \\n\\nI\'ve used a couple different cover letter formats, but I didn\'t take pictures of them over time. \\n\\n[Here](https://imgur.com/FVqx2ZZ) is the current cover letter format that I use.  I haven\'t noticed any increase in response when using a cover letter vs. not using one.\\n\\n#**Responses**\\n\\n* Before I began keeping track of my job applications, I was applying to internships my junior year. I applied for ~70 or so and was rejected or ghosted by them all. At the time, I thought 70 applications was a lot.\\n\\n* During late October of 2019, I got my first response. I did well in a phone screen and then moved to the technical portion. I dropped an easy question because I took the interview at the end of the day. It was also my first technical interview so I was nervous and found it hard to think. Lesson learned. Take your interviews at a time of day when you\'re sharp and ready (in the morning for me).\\n\\n* I\'ve received a few coding tests that automatically get sent out to candidates. I usually do okay on those, but not stellar. Not good enough to get a job apparently.\\n\\n* In June I interviewed with a local company and it went well. I passed the behavioral and the technical portion and was told I was being moved to the final interview stage where I would sit down with senior HR and management. When I followed up with them a week later the recruiter told me that they were \\"pausing\\" the position.\\n\\n#**My \\"Software Engineering\\" experience**\\n\\n\\n**Job Offer**\\n\\nIf you were to go through my spreadsheet you\'d see that I actually got an offer! I removed the companies name from the spreadsheet so as to not dox them since my experience there was very negative.\\n\\nLate December of 2019 I applied for a Software Engineering job on Indeed. The listing was for a full time SWE and the pay was listed as 4,000 - 7,000/mo. The CEO got in touch with me and I interviewed the same day I applied. The interview went well and he offered me an \\"internship\\" as a contractor for $17.50/hr. \\n\\nI knew it was a bad offer, especially for California, but I accepted because I was desperate and foolish.\\n\\nWithin a week of working there I knew the job wasn\'t Software Engineering and that I was getting ripped off. In the first two weeks I was there, I didn\'t see any of the \\"engineers\\" write a single line of code. \\n\\nI was working along side the other \\"engineers\\" getting deliverables out to clients. The other \\"engineers\\" were making 60k+/yr salaried and I was making less than 30k/yr as a contractor. I\'m pretty sure its illegal in California to hire someone as a contractor to do the same work an employee is doing (look at AB5), but that\'s beside the point. \\n\\nI stayed because it was experience I could put on my resume. At the end of March half of the company, myself included, was laid off due to covid. \\n\\n**HPE Internship Offer**\\n\\nIn late February I applied for and was interviewed for a summer internship with HPE. There were two rounds, one behavioral and one technical and I did well in both. The recruiter called me and offered me the position verbally and I accepted. 10 minutes later she called me back and asked me if I would be returning to school for Fall 2020. I said no, because I had planned to graduate in May. She rescinded the internship offer and I was right back where I started.\\n\\nIf this ever happens to you I recommend you lie. \\n\\n#**Conclusion**\\n\\nSoftware Engineering isn\'t for everyone. I started my degree very hopeful and optimistic and now I am the opposite. If I knew it would be like this, I wouldn\'t have gone to college.\\n\\nI\'m not sure what my next steps are, but I know that I am done with Computer Science and Software Engineering. I just don\'t have the heart anymore.\\n\\n I\'m considering going back to school to study some kind of engineering.\\n\\nI hope you can gain some insight from this post and if not you may at least find the data cool to look at, or my story fun to read.\\n\\nThank you.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hz5a81/data_from_1_year_of_applying_for_software/","datetime":"2020-07-28 06:52:13 IST","votes":1105,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"A paper airplane bat","author":"Palifaith","url":"https://reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/i12r1k/a_paper_airplane_bat/","subreddit":"Damnthatsinteresting","body":"","media":"https://i.imgur.com/9p1omAk.gifv","datetime":"2020-07-31 12:08:05 IST","votes":48265,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"YSK: If you are buying a used car, test drive it to the nearest auto-parts store to have it scanned for check engine light codes.

Heres some tips for ya","author":"NoisyScrubBirb","url":"https://reddit.com/r/college/comments/i5pt7n/ive_lived_in_dorms_since_2017_and_had_9_different/","subreddit":"college","body":"So yeah as the title says I\'ve lived with a tonne of people since moving into halls, I\'ve lived with some truly awesome people who I consider close to family and on the flip side purely psychotic people who affected the health of everyone in the flat. \\nI know a lot of freshers are nervous about moving into halls for the first time so I\'m here to impart some wisdom, some of it may sound harsh but from experience it helps in the long run. \\n\\nSet your boundaries early on, don\'t wait until after freshers week to tell them what you are and aren\'t ok with, they\'ll just take the piss. Be as strict as you need to with them, only after they\'ve proven themselves should you ease up on them, its better to be told \'hey I thought you were a bitch but you\'re actually ok\' rather than \'why you such an arsehole, you used to be fun\'\\n\\nWhile first impressions are good you won\'t get to know what you flatmates are truly like until they\'re stressed and under pressure. So try not to get too attached early on, they could change into very different people over a few weeks.\\n\\nIf drama doesn\'t directly involve you, do not get involved and that includes asking what is going on cos that can be used as ammunition as you know what going on so they\'ll want your opinion. It\'s fair easier and better for your mental health to be on the sidelines.\\n\\nStuff in the communal areas WILL get messed with and sometimes broken, if its valuable to you don\'t leave it where others can get to it.\\n\\nIf pans get scratched or glasses broken or something else of yours gets broken, dont hesitate to demand it be replaced.\\n\\nGet to know your RA or the caretakers or people at reception, if you get to know them they\'ll be more willing to bend the rules. Just don\'t take the piss\\n\\nGet a support network set up as soon as possible, personal tutors, guidance tutors, academic mentors, whatever you need, it\'s far easier setting it up in the beginning so it\'s there when you need it rather than trying to find out who to talk to when your swamped with work or really down mentally \\n\\nDon\'t be intimidated by the hard man, they more often than not all bark not bite and tend to show off to their posse. Dont be threatened.\\n\\nSome freshers tend to go off the rails, it\'s the first time away from home without mum and dad to tell them what to do, if they\'re being shit, tell them and call them out, you\'re all living in that flat together and you gotta cooperate and sometimes a few people need to be knocked down a few pegs.\\n\\nIf you\'re not ok with something, speak up and stand your ground and don\'t let it be dismissed, it\'s your house too and you deserve to feel comfortable and be respected.\\n\\nIf someone ends up being an arse, feel free to give them a second chance but if they take it for granted feel free to just ignore them. You\'re under no obligation to interact with them, sometimes a sudden change of attitude from you will get them to realise they\'ve effed up. If nothing changes oh well.\\n\\nWatch out for local pets wandering around, especially cats, they tend to jump in windows and get stuck or people start feeding them and they hang around, if you can contact the owners to see if they\'re aware or lost pet pages if you can\'t. Sometimes they don\'t come home for a long time cos the students have ham.\\n\\nIf you don\'t feel safe in your flat or you don\'t feel like you\'re meshing very well, there is no shame in switching flats. Chances are if you\'re not meshing well or if your flatmates are arseholes they aren\'t really gonna care. Look after yourself and your health and safety.\\n\\nTry and find your people, some of the best friendships I\'ve had are from a single common interest or thing about ourselves and we could be completely different otherwise but join clubs, go to student union meets, post on the uni facebook group, do everything you can to find your clique, it\'ll make settling in a lot smoother.\\n\\nGet to know the local area especially shops, you may feel inclined to go to chain stores you\'re familiar with, e.g.  aldi, morrisons, whsmith, hobbycraft. But often theres local shops and food markets that sell much better quality and far lower prices and if it\'s a student town often with decent discounts. Save the high street and all so shop locally!!!\\n\\n\\nI may update this as I go but knowing me I\'ll probably forget, but if you have any specific question just lemme know and I\'ll do may best to answer","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/i5pt7n/ive_lived_in_dorms_since_2017_and_had_9_different/","datetime":"2020-08-08 06:14:41 IST","votes":897,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Global"],"archived":false},{"title":"Are there other anthologies like Love Death + Robots and Black Mirror?","author":"[deleted]","url":"https://reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/i5ozhj/are_there_other_anthologies_like_love_death/","subreddit":"scifi","body":"I love sci-fi anthologies like Black Mirror and Love Death + Robots.

However, the bad rep is mostly attached to the heavily marketed, big budget productions. The hidden gems can be mostly found on independently produced, international movies.\\n\\nI\'ve compiled a list of *some* of what I think are the **best Netflix Originals, both Netflix-produced and distributed (meaning they didn\'t produce it, but bought the distribution rights after watching it at a festival.)**\\n\\n* Calibre (2018): Two best friends go hunting and accidentally kill a person. The film is so tense and hard to watch that I had to pause it several times because I couldn\'t take it. https://www.netflix.com/title/80198478\\n\\n* Cam (2018): It feels like this movie came out of nowhere and I my expectations were so low that I ended up loving it. It\'s a horror/thriller in which a cam girl finds her clone doing another live show and her online identity is completely stolen. https://www.netflix.com/title/80177400\\n\\n* November 13: Attack on Paris: A devastating three-part docuseries about the terrorist attack that took place in Paris November 2015. It features interviews from both the survivors and first responders. I wasn\'t able to watch more than one episode per day because it\'s so depressing. https://www.netflix.com/title/80190097\\n\\n* Sunday\'s Illness (La Enfermedad del Domingo): A Spanish movie that might feel slow to some, but whose captivating plot and eerie atmosphere will keep you glued to the screen. It\'s a mother-daughter drama that sometimes feels like a horror movie. A24 fans will love it. https://www.netflix.com/title/80131280\\n\\n* Tramps (2016): Two aspiring criminals are brought together in what feels like one of the freshest romantic comedies since 500 Days of Summer. https://netflix.com/title/80146759\\n\\n* Mirage (2018): Another Spanish movie, this time a Sci-Fi thriller in which a storm breaks the space-time continuum which then causes a parallel universe, giving the main character a chance to possibly prevent a tragic accident. Think of it like Frequency meets Fringe. https://www.netflix.com/title/80991158\\n\\n* I Don\'t Feel At Home in this World Anymore (2017): A dark comedy where a woman teams up with her eccentric neighbor to get revenge on the people who robbed her apartment. It\'s extremely entertaining, but when you think about it, it\'s a weird love story. https://www.netflix.com/title/80100937\\n\\n* Amanda Knox (2016): True crime fans will enjoy this documentary about an American girl who allegedly murdered a student in Italy. https://www.netflix.com/title/80081155\\n\\n* Cargo (2018): Martin Freeman stars in this post-apocalyptic thriller about a father trying to find a home for his daughter after a pandemic. https://www.netflix.com/title/80161216\\n\\n* Audrey and Daisy: This devastating doc explores the suicide of two teenage girls who got sexually assaulted and cyberbullied after drinking at a high school party. https://www.netflix.com/title/80097321\\n\\n* Shimmer Lake (2017): In a small town, a group of sheriffs try to track down three bank robbery suspects. It\'s like a watered-down version of Fargo, but still funny and entertaining. https://www.netflix.com/title/80103734 \\n\\n* The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind (2019): A boy tries to save his family from a famine by learning to build a windmill on his own. https://www.netflix.com/title/80200047\\n\\n* One of Us (2017): Documentary where some members of Brooklyn\'s Hasidic community open up about the emotional toll and consequences of trying to leave their community. https://www.netflix.com/title/80118101\\n\\n* The Discovery (2017): The movie\'s universe is one where the afterlife has been scientifically proven. The critics kinda trashed this one (it has 44% on Rotten Tomatoes), but as lover of Sci-Fi and metaphysical questions, the film presents a lot of interesting ideas and it\'s impossible not to be captivated by it if you like those themes. https://www.netflix.com/title/80115857\\n\\n* Gerald\'s Game: Based on Stephen King\'s novel, a woman is left handcuffed to her bed after her husband suddenly dies while trying to spice up their sex life. https://www.netflix.com/title/80128722","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/iaufjf/not_all_netflix_movies_are_bad_its_just_that_the/","datetime":"2020-08-16 21:08:56 IST","votes":39482,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"What is the worst text message you could wake up to?","author":"jdparmenter","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ib59pg/what_is_the_worst_text_message_you_could_wake_up/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ib59pg/what_is_the_worst_text_message_you_could_wake_up/","datetime":"2020-08-17 07:28:41 IST","votes":8843,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"LPT: Before taking out the trash, check to see if there is any old food in the fridge that needs to be thrown away.","author":"boogiefever1997","url":"https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ibexks/lpt_before_taking_out_the_trash_check_to_see_if/","subreddit":"LifeProTips","body":"[removed]","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ibexks/lpt_before_taking_out_the_trash_check_to_see_if/","datetime":"2020-08-17 19:46:02 IST","votes":17408,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Home & Garden"],"archived":false},{"title":"How do you get over someone?","author":"ceelery","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ibw808/how_do_you_get_over_someone/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ibw808/how_do_you_get_over_someone/","datetime":"2020-08-18 12:34:01 IST","votes":62000,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"YSK: If you feel you need therapy but can\u2019t afford it, many places offer sliding-scale payment.","author":"lisanik","url":"https://reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ibz91q/ysk_if_you_feel_you_need_therapy_but_cant_afford/","subreddit":"YouShouldKnow","body":"EDIT: I am continuing to add to the master list of links in the main post as I do more research. \\n\\nThis is a comment I make frequently (US specific), so I thought I\u2019d add it here. I\u2019ve helped a number of strangers find sliding-scale places in their areas. My partner once went for free for two years because of his financial situation. I recently helped someone else find a good therapist in their area for $30 a session. \\n\\nSo if you feel like you need help\u2014depression, anxiety, grief, trauma, etc\u2014but don\u2019t think you can afford it, make sure that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019m happy to help anyone look into their options. \\n\\nAnother great resource if you\u2019re in the States is [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Blogs/NAMI-Blog/September-2016/How-Texting-Can-Help-Save-a-Life). You can literally text them for resources in your area. \\n\\nFinally, we tend to treat the brain differently than other parts of the body. As I often say to my students who are struggling, if you had low blood sugar, would you yell at it to raise itself? A broken foot? Of course not. You\u2019d go to the doctor. The same should apply to the brain. There is no shame in seeking help. I\u2019m fact, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s courageous. \\n\\nHugs to everyone who\u2019s struggling.\\n\\nEdit: many people are reaching out to me via message. I will do my best to help each and every one of you, but please be a little patient; the floodgates have opened. \\n\\nAlso, I\u2019m proud of every single person who has had the courage to reach out, is now seeking therapy, or is even thinking about therapy. Make yourself a priority. You\u2019re worth it.\\n\\nEdit #2: Y\u2019all are amazing. Thank you to everyone for the awards.\\n\\nEdit #3: my phone is about to die, and I need to rest for a while (I\u2019m quite ill). But I will be back later on, so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\\n\\nEdit #4: I\u2019m going to go cuddle my dog and shut my brain down for the night, but I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to keep responding to DMs and comments. Rest well, y\u2019all.\\n\\nEdit #5: Lists I\u2019ve put together for folks.

AMA.","author":"NeedsMoreFlow","url":"https://reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/6j9iln/i_was_an_mock_interviewer_for_gainlo_a_service/","subreddit":"computerscience","body":"## TLDR\\nI don\u2019t recommend Gainlo, and I will be happy if you use anyone but Jake. Yes, I do offer mock interviews.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### About Me\\n\\nI\u2019ve worked at FAANG companies for most of my software engineering career and built a software engineering curriculum for a bootcamp. I tried being a mock interviewer with Gainlo for a short while as a side hustle but I realized it wasn\u2019t a trustworthy environment.\\n\\nSince then, I\u2019ve run >1000 coding & system design interviews since 2012 and know how to educate others deeply about software concepts.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### My Experience w/ Gainlo (Mocki.co)\\n\\nI was an interviewer for this company/guy for a couple of weeks to test the waters, see how it operates, and if it was legitimate. The appeal of Gainlo is supposed to be that your interviewers are FANG engineers and get risk-free feedback. The person/group behind Gainlo, [\u201cJake\u201d](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-cook-259bab101/), acts as the middle-man and matchmaker for candidates and charges $300+.\\n\\nThere were 4 main problems with this:\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent/Low-quality interviewers:** A friend was quoted $300 for an entry-level interview by Jake. For perspective, I was paid $75/hr after negotiating. I doubt you\u2019ll get a good, verified, professional interviewer if he is willing to take that small of a cut.\\n2. **Questionable authenticity of interviewers:** All it takes for someone to be an interviewer is to send Jake a LinkedIn profile from a convincing e-mail address that matches that person\u2019s profile name.\\n3. **The interviewer\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t matter:** [Your interviewer can be complete crap, and that\u2019s your loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/7wmp0k/rant_i_feel_pretty_cheated_paying_for_this_mock/) Jake doesn\u2019t assess the people he works with. He just wants to pocket his share and get out of the equation. In the link above, that indifferent interviewer still got paid for doing nothing for you.\\n4. **No professionalism:** [There\u2019s no refund policy](https://imgur.com/BJe6dHk). He pays interviewers when he remembers rather than on a schedule. He scheduled me for times that I explicitly said I was unavailable. He\u2019s very disorganized.\\n\\nThey are taking a huge cut for playing matchmaker when people could instead be getting interviews for free or at least get bids on Reddit forums for mock interviews. **Even if you don\u2019t use me, I\u2019ll be happy if you don\u2019t use Gainlo**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Free Resources\\n\\nIf you\u2019re not ready for mock interviews, there are so many free practice coding exercises available: /r/CSCareerQuestions, /r/CS_Questions, /r/AskComputerScience, /r/ComputerScience, /r/learnprogramming, https://www.pramp.com (Peer-2-Peer), https://www.interviewbit.com, LeetCode, InterviewCake, HackerRank\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Are you still doing mock interviews in 2024?\\n\\nYeah, you can book with me on [my Calendly page](https://calendly.com/tonyforthenguyen/mock-interview), no payment upfront.

But this is a smaller portion of the interview than you might realize.\\n\\nWhen you interview for an IT position, they\'re looking for a few critical things:\\n\\n - Technical knowledge, of course\\n - Personality / attitude\\n - Culture fit\\n - Able to respond quickly & coherently to questions\\n\\nSo even if you go into an interview with a very weak grasp of the technical side of things, the other items can more than make up for that.\\n\\nWhen I look at candidates, I absolutely ask a few technical questions, but I\'m not that concerned with whether the answer is right or wrong - I\'m more concerned with HOW they answer.\\n\\nIf I ask something very complex with multiple steps, I want to see them thinking through a logical problem-solving process.\\n\\nIf I ask them something old and obscure, it\'s to make sure they know how to say, \\"I don\'t know\\".  \\n\\nIf I ask them to solve a problem they couldn\'t possibly know the answer to (such as a process unique to my company), I want them to tell me how they\'d figure it out by talking to other people & asking for help.\\n\\nBut as I said, the other attributes can more than make up for weak technical knowledge.  Comparatively speaking, technical skills are EASY to pick up.  Show me a smart, engaging, outgoing person with a good personality and weak technical skills, and I\'ll take them all day long over the person with 8 certifications who can\'t make eye contact and does the dead fish handshake.\\n\\nSo when you have an interview and you want to prepare?  Do practice interviews.  Practice shaking hands and making eye contact.  Practice sitting up straight and talking clearly.  Do some research on the company and come in armed with some questions and comments about them (protip: read all of the recent press releases on the company website for easy talking points).\\n\\nBut don\'t spend your time trying to cram technical knowledge into your head.  You\'ll end up worrying too much about that and then your nerves will show through.\\n\\nYou know what you know - don\'t sweat it if you can\'t answer everything.  Just be prepared to explain how you\'d find the answer for them.\\n\\nGood luck out there!","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5y7umg/psa_interviews_are_not_exams_dont_cram_for_them/","datetime":"2017-03-08 18:50:40 IST","votes":219,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"Men, in what ways do you feel the most misunderstood by women?","author":"Catnplantladyy","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/jsg1lq/men_in_what_ways_do_you_feel_the_most/","subreddit":"AskMen","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/jsg1lq/men_in_what_ways_do_you_feel_the_most/","datetime":"2020-11-12 01:57:15 IST","votes":17467,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"What is clearly a scam but is so normalized people don\u2019t notice?","author":"yvngjiffy703","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k96kun/what_is_clearly_a_scam_but_is_so_normalized/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k96kun/what_is_clearly_a_scam_but_is_so_normalized/","datetime":"2020-12-08 21:18:44 IST","votes":85870,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"LPT: Make sure you travel with your partner before getting married!","author":"why_doineedausername","url":"https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kb9eyh/lpt_make_sure_you_travel_with_your_partner_before/","subreddit":"LifeProTips","body":"[removed]","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kb9eyh/lpt_make_sure_you_travel_with_your_partner_before/","datetime":"2020-12-12 00:56:22 IST","votes":6926,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Miscellaneous"],"archived":false},{"title":"What is something unrealistic that you often see in movies that annoys the hell out of you?","author":"sonsaitama","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kb2t3w/what_is_something_unrealistic_that_you_often_see/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kb2t3w/what_is_something_unrealistic_that_you_often_see/","datetime":"2020-12-11 19:01:03 IST","votes":56740,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"YSK If you\'re uncomfortable for no apparent reason, try some of these fixes:","author":"Snuggly-Muffin","url":"https://reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kf71c9/ysk_if_youre_uncomfortable_for_no_apparent_reason/","subreddit":"YouShouldKnow","body":"Why YSK: Most people can be comfortable if they figure out what causes their discomfort and deal with it and/or try these methods! I recently discovered that years of frequent discomfort was being caused by nipple chaffing, and bandaids basically cured it right away.\\n\\n1. Do yoga or stretches before and/or after bed. even 10-20 minutes helps, but the more the better.\\n2. Take a shower and put on moisturizer right after. Never too hot or too long.  /u/dizzley would add that you should try a range of moisturizers until you find one to suit. People\'s needs differ. I use a product called Aveeno and my second choice is Aqueous Cream as it\'s called in the UK.  /u/kikistiel Would like to add to number 2, before you put moisturizer on gently pat a toner on as well. People always forget the toner step but it\u2019s so important! Imagine rubbing lotion on an dry sponge (no toner) vs a wet sponge (toner). It absorbs into the skin so much better and really makes a difference. You can get toners super cheap and I swear it\u2019s like night and day :)\\n3. If your skin often feels irritated, try buying softer clothing like undershirts and underwear.  /u/stoicsticks said:  If you\'re not sure if a fabric is going to be scratchy to wear, try rubbing it lightly against the inside of your wrist. The skin there is more sensitive than your hands or fingertips.  \\n4. If your nipples area often feels uncomfortable it could be due to chaffing. You can put on a bandaid with almond or olive oil.\\n5. Correct your posture by being mindful of it throughout the day and doing stretches.  *Sleep in a good position with knee and neck support.  If your mattress sucks, biy a mattress topper.\\n6. Foam roll and do warmups before and after exercising.  Always follow exercise routines to prevent muscle imbalances and to prevent overtraining.\\n7. Take some deep breaths and relax.  Sometimes tension is held unconsciously, but you can consciously release it.  Relaxing on the exhale works very well for relaxing.\\n8. Take care of your bodies basic needs which definitely includes exercise.\\n\\nSource:  [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-benefits-of-yoga)\\n\\nTips added by commenters:\\n1.  /u/sojayn Check your sensory overload.  Sometimes (for some people) background noise/lights/temperature translates into a physical restlessness or discomfit. Especially when working or focused and forgetting about your physicality. Try nature sounds headphones, adjust lighting and dress for the temperature.\\n2.  /u/5T6Rf6ut Drink some damn water. You\'re probably not properly hydrated.\\n3.  /u/catfurcoat I recommend the Downdog app for yoga but if you want something for free then the FitOn app has some yoga and bedtime routines (as well as a lot of good exercise videos) or Yoga With Adrienne on YT\\n4.  /u/jarredknowledge Strengthening our posterior chain goes a long way in alleviating issues surrounding static lifestyle and the inevitable posture issues that come with that\\n5.  /u/skbat As an introvert - get some alone time. Read, watch tv, whatever. Get the house to yourself if possible. When I\'m grumpy it\'s almost always because I need alone time.\\n6.  /u/dvof meditate.  clear your mind and focus on yourself and surrounding. You\'ll become aware of tension in parts of the body that you hadn\'t before. Also try not to think about anything, your mind will probably wander off to something, but try to become aware of it and dissapate the thought. Then again focus on your body, breathing and surrounding again, actively thinking about nothing but the current moment. This basically gives your brain a moment to pause for a second and it really works.\\n7.  /u/YourLocalAnarch Another really good tip from my occupational physiotherapist and especially if you work from home: Always have your mouse at the same level as your elbow. Doing it so won\'t force your body more than it should, especially your posture.  If possible have your screen at the same level of your eyes as well!  /u/LadyJig adds:  In reference to sitting at a desk:  A good quality chair is super important. You may here the term \\"ergonomic\\" thrown around a lot, but it\'s actually incredibly important. Chronic pain often arises from poorly fitted but often used equipment, like a desk chair. Ideally, you want your knees to be at a 90deg angle, good back and neck support, and your arms to rest comfortably at a neutral angle. It\'s also preferable to keep your head straight as much as possible, otherwise you will fatigue your neck.  If you\'d like to see how good your desk is, check out this assessment!  Source: me, a Human Factors Engineering student who did a gigantic project on ergonomics\\n8.  /u/rojm Write down the things that are bothering you and what you will do about it or how you should feel or cope or learn from it. I use the checklist in my phone\u2019s notes app. Negative thoughts have been intruding and they are very irrational and I know this and writing down how I felt finally turned off those thoughts.\\n9.  /u/Kost_Gefernon Feeling irritated or that you are tensing up or clenching your teeth and can\u2019t seem to stop?  Force yourself to smile, then open your mouth wide to stretch your jaw. Repeat a few times.  Add in some double chins (moving your head back to make a double chin while keeping your head upright), and rub the back of your neck.  Poor head posture can cause a chain reaction of tension that leads to tight jaws and a headache. You don\u2019t know what is causing it, which antagonizes the negative feeling, and the situation feeds itself. You can turn it off by smiling.\\n10.  /u/LiezLies Left to right rhythmic movements and things that engage symmetrical body movements - things like walking up and down the hall while on a phone call, swimming laps (particularly breaststroke), knitting or crocheting. We see this in animals when they pace up and down.\\n11.  /u/LiezLies Intuitive movement - quite literally shaking it out. Put a song on, and move your body however feels good, don\u2019t try to dance, just move your body, including shaking movements. We see this in dogs when they shake after a tense situation.\\n12.  /u/awreathafranklin You might be in actual danger. I\'m surprised no one has said this yet. We have been taught to \\"rationalise\\" warning signs are bodies are telling us. Assess your surroundings. Is there anyone you are unfamiliar with or who just entered the immediate space? Is that when you became \\"uncomfortable\\"? In the event you need to get out, where are you exits? Does anyone know where you are right now? Is there anyone around you that you can trust? Trust your gut, worst case you\'re wrong and still safe. Uncomfortable can mean so many things. LPT: Become comfortable with your body and learn to listen. (I\'m adding that doing slow deep breathing can take you out of fight or flight mode)\\n13.  /u/magicEightballA_A Food is also important. Eat fruit man. Lots of it. I hate eating vegetables but I love fruit so started eat more of that and lemme tell you, it helps. I have lots more energy throughout the day and it definitely helps. I eat bananas in the morning, some citrus like oranges after lunch and sometimes an odd pear or apple with dinner.\\n14.  /u/7moonwalker7 Go alone for a walk in a forest or park. Or any nature area. I love going deep into a forest at night, especially in the winter when I can enjoy the stars, northern lights and the snow covered trees.\\n15.  /u/Stalinwolf Take some magnesium too. 150mg of Magnesium Citrate is my jam.  /u/ispebblespeople DONT supplement minerals at random! Minerals in too high amounts will poison you. The tip should instead be to take a blood test to check your levels and supplement accordingly, or track your diet for a few days in e.g. chronometer and supplement only if you\'re consistently low balling certain minerals  (I\'ll add:  make sure you supplement anything your diet is low in, or adding nutrient dense foods with what you\'re low in of course is better.)\\n16.  /u/Ill_Age_1853 I used to have trouble sleeping until I started stretching my knees out\\n17.  /u/shapeshifter83 My discomfort has always come from my lower digestive system. My tips are: smaller portions, keto/low carb (less gas production down there), avoid coffee/dairy/spicy, intake dietary fiber on the regular or take a fiber pill, regular exercise, pants that sit very high and fit right.  Also I\'m mildly autistic with the typical autistic tendency to dislike things on my skin while paradoxically also disliking to feel uncovered, sleeping naked underneath a weighted blanket has been great.\\n18.  /u/steakndbud I\'d recommend a theracane over foam rolling. Much more intuitive to use correctly.\\n19.  /u/Mondonodo I\'m gonna be the horndog of the thread when I say this, but maybe try masturbating. Can be a nice stress release.\\n20.  /u/KeithMyArthe I\'d add... listen to any feelings of nagging dread or doubt. \\n I developed sepsis due to a blockage in one kidney. There was no pain, pretty much asymptomatic except for an overwhelming fear that something wasn\'t right.  The ER doctor told me that if I had slept on it I might not have made it to the hospital. He estimated 10 to 12 hours before it became unlikely they could have dealt with it as effectively as they did.\\n21.  /u/DopeandDiamonds If you are uncomfortable just ask yourself  \\"Am I doing OK?\\"  \\"Do I feel comfortable?\\"  \\"How can I be happy in this moment?\\"  So much of our internal discomfort comes from simply not checking in on how we are doing mentally. Some people need that outlet of being asked how they are to really take a moment and reflect.  It sounds dumb and simple but sometimes we need to have a mental check in. I have done this and burst into tears without knowing I was holding shit in that I couldn\'t manage.\\n22.  /u/marlboroprincess I\u2019m late to this party, but make sure you\u2019re aware of your stimulant intake. Too much caffeine in a day will give me a \u201cbees in my teeth\u201d type feeling. Like my skin is itchy on the inside of my body. I can\u2019t shake and it can trigger a panic episode until i remember that i had a giant coffee or whatever. Have a glass of water, it will help your body metabolize caffeine :)\\n23.  /u/Sapiencia6 Sometimes you might find yourself irritable and annoyed by every little thing, the natural noises of your environment are suddenly grating, the light just isn\'t right, etc. Stress and anxiety can cause your sensory input to be overwhelming. Even if you don\'t feel that you would have any reason to suffer from sensory overload, keep some grounding exercises in your back pocket for when something \\"feels wrong\\" but you don\'t know why.  1.  Focus on a tangible item in your environment. Think of as many adjectives as you can to describe it using each of your senses. What can you say about its visual appearance? What does it smell like, or what do you imagine it smells like? What would it sound like if you used it to make a noise? What does it feel like? What would it taste like? Do this for as many things in your surrounding as you need until you feel relaxed.  2.  Close your eyes and take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Count slowly to seven while you inhale, hold for seven, and time your exhale to seven. Then focus on tensing and releasing every muscle in your body, one by one, working down from your head to your toes. You may not realize where your body is holding tension, especially in your face. Tense your forehead, release. Tense your eyes, release. Your nose. Your jaw. Your whole face. Your neck. Your shoulders. Etc. By the time you reach your toes you will have hopefully relaxed your whole body.\\n24.  /u/glockGotaDick  Also try the Wim Hof method, super relaxing breathing method","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/kf71c9/ysk_if_youre_uncomfortable_for_no_apparent_reason/","datetime":"2020-12-18 03:15:20 IST","votes":19984,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"How important is penetrative sex in a relationship?","author":"WinterCherryPie","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/kft17i/how_important_is_penetrative_sex_in_a_relationship/","subreddit":"AskMen","body":"I am a 30 something breast cancer survivor.

I have been seeking treatment for this side effect from my oncologist and am actively working on solving this issue. I currently had a long distance boyfriend (due to my need to continue chemo close to home and not move provinces) so it has not been a big issue. I am feeling pretty insecure because I don\'t know how long these side effects might last. I will have to go one hormonal treatment that causes similar side effects. Would this be a deal breaker for most men? I want to please my partner and also want to be sexually active in this way.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you all for your input! I never imagined that I would get so many responses. Thank you especially for sharing your personal experiences with similar issues. I cannot respond to all of you but will get to those you sent me a private message. \\n\\nI want to clarify that my guy is in no way demanding or pressuring me into sex. He is very gentle with me. He is also very capable of pleasing me in other ways. This question stems more from me feeling guilt and self-conscious about my situation. \\n\\nPlease understand that the changes a person undergoes while having and being treated for cancer are immense. I also want to reassure you that I have every reason to believe that I will beat this (my last scan at the end of October showed no evidence of cancer). I am currently on a  chemo that does not cause systematic side effects like those portrayed on TV. My chemo is designed to target only cancerous cells - very interesting stuff. It\'s call Kadcyla for those of you who are interested. I am on this to reduce my chances of reoccurrence.

During those years in college I saw constant pressure to practice online coding challenges and to get an internship at Google, Microsoft, etc, but truthfully I dislike the sound of either of those, I wanted to go into healthcare\\n\\nBy my third year I still didn\'t have any internships and had probably a 3.3 GPA, so without much direction I just started applying to as many internships as I could. I applied while in class, I applied during my lunch breaks, I applied at every moment I could find time. By the time I got an internship I racked up almost 230 applications (less than 5 had cover letters and I had no personal connections to any companies I applied to). This is what those applications resulted in\\n\\n* Number of Internships Applied to: 227\\n   * Rejections: 136\\n   * Did not hear back: 68\\n   * First Round Interviews before accepting first internship: 19\\n      * ADM, UPMC (x2), State Farm (x2), TIAA, Southwest Airlines, Principal, CarMax, Prudential, Amazon, Bank of America, HCA, Mayo Clinic (x2), Tenet, Centene, Qurate\\n   * Second Round Interviews before accepting first internship: 5\\n      * Prudential, Southwest Airlines, UPMC, Mayo Clinic (x2)\\n      * Second Round interview that came after I accepted first internship: 1\\n   * Made first round interview but didn\'t want to interview for: 4\\n      * ADM, Principal, HCA, Statefarm\\n   * First Round Interviews after accepting first internship: 11\\n      * Centene, Qurate, Principal (x2), Statefarm, Nordstrom, NextEra Energy, Verizon (x2), Stryker (x2)\\n\\nWhy I think this strategy works: Assuming all CS students are good candidates to a certain percentage of internships, if you just keep applying to internships the numbers will work themselves out eventually. What did I have going in my favor? Disregarding a very average 3.3 GPA, I was a unique candidate. I was the captain of the jump section of my track team and was pretty personable in interviews. I also had a  web scraping project to my name that was complete minimum viable product.\\n\\nMy biggest tips:\\n\\n* Get an internship even if it isn\'t your \\"dream internship\\" during your sophomore summer or junior summer if you plan on going for a senior summer internship\\n   * This is going to really give you some leverage for the next internship application cycle\\n   * If you happen to not get your dream internship the next year then you have a good backup spot and some leverage for when you apply to real jobs\\n   * This will give you some pay leverage whether at internships or jobs\\n* Focus heavily on being personable\\n   * I can\'t tell you the difference it made that the manager hiring and I felt like we had a good connection. These people are going to be spending a decent amount of time with you, so they\'d prefer to enjoy that time even if you\'re not the most \\"prestigious\\" application\\n* You can really stand out with unique qualifications\\n   * By the time I graduated I spent over a year as the president of track and field at my school\\n* Start early (September/October)\\n   * I have a suspicion that many internships don\'t get as much attention in the first week or two postings have been up if they\'re really early in internship season\\n\\nI used this strategy again the next year and now have a total of over 500 applications submitted, although it\'s easier the second time when you have an internship on your resume. Hopefully this will inspire people to stop taking leet/coding challenges so seriously and to focus more on diversifying their skill sets!","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/kkxiy9/from_23_highschool_gpa_to_80k_offer_without/","datetime":"2020-12-27 10:24:40 IST","votes":477,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"LPT: Beware the \\"Intern Trap\\". Don\'t take a job as a X Intern at a company that doesn\'t have anyone who can do X.","author":"maybeest","url":"https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kobiui/lpt_beware_the_intern_trap_dont_take_a_job_as_a_x/","subreddit":"LifeProTips","body":"Interning should be a process of learning a craft while you help to contribute to the overall institutional goals. \\n\\nIf a company is advertising for an intern position, but doesn\'t have anyone who does that job, then they are probably just trying to pay someone less for a job that they want someone to be able to do. Traditionally, these are jobs that young people are adept at, but older people may not have the skills to perform. \\n\\nFor example, they probably need/want a Social Media Manager, not a Social Media Intern, but they want to pay less, hence the title. If you interview for a position like this, ask who at the company you will be learning from. If they don\'t have someone senior in the role, they may be willing to offer a mentor in other valuable skills - a senior marketing manager, for example. \\n\\nConsider negotiating a title that reflects what you will be learning, not just what you will be contributing. This will help you develop your resume and, well, hopefully learn new skills. Also consider negotiating a title change and salary adjustment to reflect that title. \\"It seems that you don\'t have anyone at the company in a position to mentor a Social Media Intern and that what you really need is a Social Media Manager. I\'m happy to take that role, at the junior level, and prove my worth to the company.\\" \\n\\nReally take a look at the learning on offer and what it\'s worth to you - if they\'re paying you $20k less a year, then your mentorship better be up to that value. You can save yourself a lot of wasted time and money by avoiding this \\"Intern Trap\\".\\n\\nEDIT: To be clear, some internships are genuine where you trade your work for real on the job learning (and a small paycheque). These should have someone on staff who is responsible to the intern - an actual mentor - or there should be a clear trade of skills/experience for your work and time. These are not the \\"Intern Traps\\" I intended to warn about. Nor am I talking about internships or practicums related to an educational course of study.\\n\\nI\'m talking to job seekers looking for a job who might be undervaluing their skills, potentially negotiating with a company that is trying to take advantage of the applicant.  \\n\\nIn Canada, where I\'m from, unpaid internships are (now) illegal, though were prevalent early in my career. These privilege people who have enough resources and support to be able to give their time and labour away without financial compensation and disadvantage people who can\'t afford to work for free because they have bills to pay.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the Helpful awards and the Silver! My first ever and I appreciate it!\\n\\nEDIT 3: A lot of people are reading this post as anti-internship. It is not intended to be! I am very pro-internship. This is a tip to ask in the interview to determine if what is on offer is, indeed, an internship or if it is a lowball play for your skills and labour. Just know what you are getting into by asking about the mentorship, training, and skills that they plan for you to learn. If they don\'t have a plan, they *might* be exploitative. If you had a great internship experience, great! Lucky you! And thanks for sharing these experiences. It\'s great to know some people have made the best of their situations, or, indeed had a good experience with a company that does internships right.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/kobiui/lpt_beware_the_intern_trap_dont_take_a_job_as_a_x/","datetime":"2021-01-01 19:17:30 IST","votes":34017,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"What are subtle red flags at a job interview that say \\"working here would suck\\"?","author":"pbourree","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kttvdy/what_are_subtle_red_flags_at_a_job_interview_that/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/kttvdy/what_are_subtle_red_flags_at_a_job_interview_that/","datetime":"2021-01-09 21:54:54 IST","votes":92620,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"Intro to IBT Inclined Bed Therapy","author":"greyuniwave","url":"https://reddit.com/r/InclinedBedTherapy/comments/d85zjk/intro_to_ibt_inclined_bed_therapy/","subreddit":"InclinedBedTherapy","body":"#What is it?\\n\\nInclined bed therapy is where one\'s bed is raised 4 to 8 inches at the head by using bricks, wedges, or blocks to raise it.

I\'m not saying that this is the only way to land a job. Just wanted to share what worked for me and hopefully some of y\'all can adapt parts of this if you think it makes sense. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHey all,\\n\\nI\'ve been trying to give back more by helping those who can\'t seem down on their luck when it comes to getting that first round interview. I remember being in that position and it sucks. I\'m going to take y\'all through what worked for me, why I did it and hopefully help a few of you get that first round/phone interview. There are many good posts here telling you what you can do to land that first job, but not many helping you break through that barrier of getting the first round interview.\\n\\nThe main reason why I\'m doing this is that I see at least 10 posts a day of people saying they can\'t get a callback or posts claiming that to get a job you need to do 1000 LeetCode problems a day.\\n\\nThe format of this post will be as follows:\\n\\n* General tips\\n* What worked for me(I was job hunting while not having a job)\\n* Following up on a job application\\n* My daily schedule\\n* Tools that I used to make my job hunt easier\\n* How you can adjust parts of this process if you do currently have a job\\n* Relevant link(s)\\n* Closing notes\\n\\n# General tips:\\n\\n* Don\'t just spray and pray. Yes, this will let you apply for thousands of jobs a day, but you probably aren\'t interested in most of them and it\'ll make the process outlined below difficult to follow.\\n* Follow up for every single job you apply for(if a blocker is that you can\'t find the email address of who you need to follow up with, look in the Tools section).\\n* You get what you put in. Job hunting is hard, but it requires persistence. The job you want isn\'t going to come to you just because you clicked the easy apply button on LinkedIn.\\n* If you\'re stressed out about not being able to get LeetCode questions done, start off with 1 a day and time box them. There is no shame at looking at how others solved a similar problem, as long as you\'re learning and not copying and pasting, you\'ll get better. Algo questions during the interview process is about finding a pattern and matching it to the practice questions that you\'ve done.\\n* Have a daily schedule for follow Monday - Friday and stick to it, I\'ll list mine below.\\n* Don\'t stress out over this subreddit, I don\'t believe 25% of the posts I read on here.\\n\\n# What worked for me:\\n\\nI kept track of every job I applied for(so I can send followups and not waste time trying to figure out if I had already applied for a job). I did so by using Trello board. I\'ll include a link at the end of this post. I would apply for 10-15 jobs a day. I\'d follow up twice with for every job that I applied to(with a week separating each followup, examples below), before I moved it to the Rejected column of my board.\\n\\n# Following up on a job application:\\n\\nI would apply for jobs on Monday - Friday, but only send follow ups from Tuesday - Thursday. Reason being(this is an opinion) most people don\'t like doing work on Monday and Friday(also, anytime my follow up date fell on a holiday, I would just send the email the following day). I didn\'t want my email to get lost amongst the weekend emails. I also always attached my resume to all my follow up emails, you\'d do this because you make want to make people\'s lives easier. They\'re more likely to respond if they don\'t have to search for you in their job portal.\\n\\n* Example 1: If I applied for a job on 2/8/2021(which is a Monday), I would send my first follow up email on 2/16/2021(a Tuesday) and the second follow up email on (2/23/2021)(a Tuesday).\\n* Example 2: If I applied for a job on 2/19/2021(which is a Friday), I would send my first follow up email on 3/2/2021(a Tuesday) and the second follow up email on (3/9/2021)(a Tuesday).\\n* Example 3: If I applied for a job on 2/24/2021(which is a Wednesday), I would send my first follow up email on 3/2/2021(a Wednesday) and the second follow up email on (3/10/2021)(a Wednesday).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**My first follow up email:**\\n\\n    Hi {{name of person}},\\n    \\n    On {{date when you applied, which you should have since it\'s on your Trello board :) }}, I applied for the {{position title}} at {{name of company}}.\\n     \\n    Since then, I haven\'t heard back from anybody and was hoping either you or a colleague could help shed some light on the situation and let me know if the position has been filled or if I\'m still in consideration for the role.\\n    \\n    I\'ve also attached my resume.\\n    \\n    \\n    Thanks for your time,\\n    \\n    {{your name}}\\n\\n**My second follow up email:**\\n\\n    Hi {{name of person}},\\n    \\n    I\'m not to sure if you received my previous email, but I\'m following up on my job application for the {{position title}} at {{name of company}} {{date of when you originally applied for the position}}.\\n    \\n    If you or a colleague can let me know if the position has been filled or if I\'m still in consideration, that would be greatly appreciated. \\n    \\n    I\'ve also attached my resume.\\n    \\n    Regards,\\n    \\n    {{your name}}\\n\\n# My daily schedule:\\n\\n* Wake up at 9:30am and apply for jobs between 10am-1pm and have lunch.\\n* Send follow ups from 1pm-3pm.\\n* From 3pm and onwards, I would work on a personal project or work on LeetCode.\\n* After 8pm, I\'d RELAX. Seriously everyone, don\'t underestimate this. You need to relax to let your brain recover and be ready for the next day. Otherwise you\'ll just end up sad and questioning what you\'re doing.\\n\\n# Tools that I used to make my job hunt easier:\\n\\n* I used Trello for keeping track of the jobs I applied to.\\n* I used SellHack to find the emails of the Recruiter, CTO or whoever was responsible for keeping track  the job applicants. They only give you 10 free searches a month per account, but you can just create a bunch of accounts. If there is no email or person listed to contact, just use LinkedIn and find someone to email. If it\'s a small company, email the CTO, if it\'s a larger company, email a Technical Recruiter in your area. If after 20 mins of trying, you can\'t find someone to email or your emails keep getting bounced back, just move on.\\n\\n# How you can adjust parts of this process if you do currently have a job:\\n\\nI was able to follow my schedule because I didn\'t have a job. If you do have a job, you may be wondering how you can prepare and send followups during the middle of the day. I won\'t say that the process is easy, but you can do it mainly by preparing them emails in advance. If you know you have to send out followups the next business day, prepare them the night before(or the weekend before). That way all you need to do is click the send button.\\n\\n* Example 1: If you have 5 follow ups to send out on Tuesday, prepare them on Saturday or Sunday.\\n* Example 2: If you have to send out 5 follow ups on Wednesday and you were busy the weekend prior, prepare them on Monday or Tuesday night.\\n\\nYou can also apply for jobs at night, use the time where ever you can find it.\\n\\n# Relevant link(s):\\n\\n* PDF of my Trello board(just used the first PDF hosting site I could find, if anyone has a better site, please let me know) - [tinyurl.com/1laxxext](https://tinyurl.com/1laxxext)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n# Closing notes:\\n\\nI wish y\'all the best of luck. If you have any questions, please reach out. I don\'t sign on to Reddit all that often, but I check it at least once a week.\\n\\nY\'all got it, and don\'t be afraid of being rejected from jobs, it may feel like the end of the word at that moment, but other doors to open. On my personal Trello board, the longest list was my Rejected column, but that was ok. All you need is that 1 offer to get you started.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lf4fst/the_process_that_landed_me_first_round_interviews/","datetime":"2021-02-08 10:25:52 IST","votes":852,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"LPT Are you a content creator or streamer and need some quality background music for your videos?

Experienced is in quotes because five years isn\'t whole lot, but I\'m definitely not new grad anymore. I\'ve given dozens of interviews, was a manager for couple of years in my previous company, and met with hundreds of job seekers at career fairs. This subreddit was great when I was looking for new jobs, but it seems now more than ever saturated by either new grads or students, so wanted to give some perspectives on how to get that first job. Everything is my personal opinion, and will be geared towards people looking for entry level swe positions.\\n\\nSo you\'ve been applying. You\'ve had few bites here and there, but no real offer yet. Some people say job search is numbers game, which is true, to an extent. But if you spend some time introspecting on what you are lacking, then you can hugely improve your odds. There are three main components to job search: your resume, people skill, technical interview skill.\\n\\nFirst your resume, this is your foundation. If the foundation is solid, it will make your job searching that much easier. You can tell your resume is lacking if your callback rate is low. If your resume isn\'t the best, then your focus should be improving this. Because it doesn\'t matter how good of engineer you are or master leetcoder, if you never get an interview in first place to able to show them. Formatting and wording is important, but what I usually look for when looking at resumes of new grads is whether they have internships or significant personal projects. Internship is usually better than personal projects, but if you are having hard time getting internship or it doesn\'t work with your timeline, then spend couple of months making personal project or, better yet, getting a group of friends to do a project and join hackathons. This not only boosts your resume but also gives you talking points in your interviews. 80 percent of the companies will ask you to tell them about something you built.\\n\\nNow the personal skills. Or as I would like to call it, do you know how to function in a professional setting. If you pass the resume screening (and online assessments) first step is usually a recruiter call. They are looking for red flags and whether you are really interested in their company. So smile, look engaged, and most importantly sound excited for the opportunity. Do some research about the company beforehand, ask meaningful questions and not something like \\"is the lunch free?\\"\\n\\nLastly the technical assessment. This is the most dreaded part for most people. Alas, there isn\'t a golden bullet here. You just have to grind. Grind leetcode, hit the books, and you will get better eventually. But be sure to leetcode intentionally. Meaning you don\'t always look at solutions after being stuck couple of minutes. If you had to look at a solution to solve a question, then try redoing it right away or the day after, you will be surprised how many questions you\'ve done before you can\'t do anymore, this just means you didn\'t truly master the concept, so take it as sign to study more.\\n\\nLastly, learn from your failures. Unless you are very lucky or all star new grad from Stanford with 5 internships, you will fail your first interviews. The company will also never tell you what the issue was, so spend time on your own what you think went wrong. Was it technical question? Did you say something wrong? Were you too nervous? Debrief with your friends and mentors. And pat on yourself on the back, because that just means you just got that much better at interviewing.  Think of it as getting exp points in interviewing skills. Also remember that luck plays a huge factor in interviews. So keep trying and don\'t talk rejections personally. Learn from them and eventually you will have an offer.\\n\\nHope my perspective will be helpful to at least some of you. Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments. I\'ll answer all of them.\\n\\nEdit: If you could do me a favor and ask your question as a top level comment, that would make it easier for me to find you. Thank you.\\nEdit2: Adding a couple of caveats here, I\'m an American so some suggestions might not be as valid in your home country. Also it\'s for someone looking for a general SWE engineer role, so for breaking into specific industry like AI, embedded, etc, the process is a bit different.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mwhue9/how_to_get_first_job_as_swe_two_cents_from_an/","datetime":"2021-04-23 04:59:42 IST","votes":1129,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Experienced"],"archived":false},{"title":"Guide: Soft skills to help you make Senior Engineer","author":"cheesecakesquared","url":"https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/mxdp42/guide_soft_skills_to_help_you_make_senior_engineer/","subreddit":"cscareerquestions","body":"I\'ve seen some people on this board, and in my professional career struggle to make it out of being a mid level engineer.    Some of these people have really good technical ability, but I truly believe it\'s a bit more than that.   I decided to share some tips of what I\'ve picked up on my journey to becoming a senior engineer.   I hope this may help some people who are struggling with this.\\n\\nBackground - I have 5 years of professional experience as an SWE, and I\'ve been a senior level engineer for > 1 year.\\n\\nTips\\n\\n1. When communicating about anything to anyone, put yourself in their shoes\\n\\nALWAYS keep this in the back of your head when you communicate with anyone about anything.    If you are talking a manager, who is not a developer, think about someone who doesn\'t understand code.   Try to avoid as much nitty gritty and technical jargon as possible to get your point across.    When you are talking to an end user, use even less.    When you are talking to a junior, assume they know next to nothing, and might be afraid to say that.    Ask them what they do know before explaining something.    Ask \\"Do you know what x is?\\" before going on a rant about x.   These things may take extra time, but that\'s okay.    When you are talking to a fellow engineer who is very familiar with everything, you can include more technical jargon, and get straight to the point.    Your end goal should always be serving the team to create a better product.\\n\\n2. Ownership\\n\\nMistakes are actually not as bad to make as you may think.     Producing software is a process that involves many components.    If the thing was able to make it to production, it was more of a system failure than your own individual failure.     When an issue does come up, and it was your fault, take ownership for it.   Admit it, correct it as soon as possible, and make notes of how you would improve this in the future.   One of the worst things you can do is cover it up, or blame someone else.     Everyone hates someone who plays the blame game, and it doesn\'t show good leadership.    Whenever an issue comes up and it is someone else\'s fault, I usually use \\"we\\" because it is a system process that failed ultimately.    When I make a mistake, I always use \\"I\\" because I am taking ownership of the issue.\\n\\n3.  Servant Leadership\\n\\nPeople don\'t take someone seriously as a leader if all they do is order you around, and don\'t contribute.    That\'s why, in order to be a leader, you must serve first - at all levels.   If a QA or a Junior asks you for help, take time out of your day to help them.    If you don\'t have the time, find someone who can take some time to help them.   If someone higher than you asks for help, of course help them as well.      It may seem annoying sometimes to break up your day due to things you aren\'t directly assigned to, but it pays dividends in the long term.    Eventually, people will see you as a leader.\\n\\n4.    Respect every role you work with\\n\\nDon\'t think of your position as a developer as a hierarchy.    You are not \\"above\\" a QA, or a project manager, or an end user.     Everything is one flat system.     In terms of salary, there are always people above you and below you.   However, that doesn\'t matter.    At the end of the day, every role is required to make the thing work.      Do as much as you can to help these people if they ask you questions, and be polite and respectful.\\n\\n5.    When assigned annoying, or difficult tasks, treat them as a challenge, rather than an annoyance\\n\\nI\'ve seen people on this sub complain about having to refactor stacks of legacy code with poor documentation.   It\'s fine to be frustrated with such a daunting task, but reframing your mindset goes a long way.   Instead of looking at the task as an annoyance, think about the creative freedom you\'ll have in changing this code.    Think about the skills you\'ll learn going through legacy code.   I guarantee the next time you have a stack of legacy code, you will be way better at it.    Side note:people make a LOT of money doing this type of work.  Believe it or not, grindy tasks like debugging and digging through code are a skill and you do get better at it the more you do it.\\n\\n6.   Take on tasks proactively, especially the ones nobody else wants to do.\\n\\nIf you see a pain point on your team bring it up to your team.     Take on that really annoying / frustrating issue that everyone is avoiding.    This will improve your skills as a dev, but also applies to servant leadership as well.  Of course, you have work that must get done, so you might not have time to actually do this.    When you want to do something outside of what you are assigned to, also please check with your manager before doing this.    They must be able to account for your time.\\n\\nHopefully this helps some people!

Yet the last 3 years my company had me working in the C++ plumbing side of things, solving system-specific features/issues. More recently I was moved to a lead role for various IOS projects despite my annual requests for more graphics/CV roles. I\u2019ve probably only written 4 shaders during my time here. I\u2019ve kept my projects up to date, but they aren\u2019t anything mind blowing. One weekend night, out of frustration I tossed some applications out there not expecting much, but to my surprise got callbacks for 10/13 positions, mainly at some of the giants in our industry. So I got to studying again, while continuing to work full time, and I only had 1 month to prepare. \\n\\n**The study plan:**\\n\\nMy primary areas of focus were as such in order of importance:\\n\\n1. Leetcode (85 done in 4 weeks)\\n\\n2. C++ (the usual, but with a focus on multithreading)\\n\\n3. Graphics\\n\\n4. Linear Algebra\\n\\n5. Hardware/OS\\n\\nI filled up 7 pages of paper back to back writing out my notes for #2-5. Monday-Friday, I\'d do 3 LC questions from neetcode, where I\'d attempt the problem first. After 15 minutes I\'d watch the solution, then implement it on my own. Then I\'d review the notes written up to the previous day, and write some more notes. For stuff like linear algebra I\'d do a final exam w/solutions released somewhere on google from some university. Every Saturday and Sunday was dedicated to re-doing **all** of the LC problems I\'d solved up to that point.\\n\\n**RESULTS:**\\n\\nMy resume got me good callback rates, and I made it to onsites for about half of the 10 callbacks. My study plan was great as well, there wasn\'t a single problem I wasn\'t able to solve, though they weren\'t always optimal. In the end, the odds didn\u2019t work in my favor. Out of the 10 callbacks:\\n\\n*Made to onsites:*\\n\\n- **Some fruit company:** Did perfectly on phone screen, and the tech screen. Onsite I did well on about 75% of the interviews, but it was enough to drop me from the running. I knew I was out of my league here, but it was a valuable experience.\\n\\n- **A startup:** Crushed nearly everything, some of the interviews on the onsite were a bit shaky since it seemed like they were looking for a unicorn. I honestly used this one for practice, but did get an offer. However the comp wasn\'t great and I don\'t want to be at a startup at this point in my career.\\n\\n- **A game studio owned by Microsoft:** I did solve all the problems they gave me, but it required a hint or two from the interviewer. Someone definitely just did better than me here.\\n\\n- **Company that makes VR goggles:** They didn\'t ask me a single question related to graphics lol. From beginning to end it was LC, so again someone probably just did better/faster than me, even though I found optimal solutions.\\n\\n*Dropped after tech screen:*\\n\\n- **Rainforest:** I dropped the ball on a LC-medium question that could\'ve been easily optimized, I wasn\'t on my A-game.\\n\\n- **A social media app:** Did well on the tech screen, but dropped regardless. Other candidates probably had better backgrounds.\\n\\n*Dropped after phone screen:*\\n\\n- **Companies Green, Red, Blue:** For all three, I suspect my lack of graphics driver experience was the culprit.\\n\\n- **An animation studio:** The devs on the team seemed to like me, but my lack of graphics research experience hurt my chances here.\\n\\n\\nSome obvious pros/cons about myself I could pinpoint:\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Others likely had superior/more relevant projects/experience like with graphics drivers, subdivision surfaces, CUDA, etc. That would\u2019ve helped me get past the phone screens for places like green and stand out better for the other stages.\\n\\n- All the tech screens were solely Leetcode. I at least solved all of the ones they gave me, but sometimes had trouble pinpointing how I could optimize or shorten some of them. More grinding is required for the top positions\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- I am very experienced in various parts of the stack with multiple languages and platforms (which happened unintentionally because of my company haha). Companies were interested because of it, hence the good callback rate.\\n\\n- I may be an introvert, but I can communicate effectively and quickly build rapport. Even if a problem doesn\u2019t go my way, I can talk my way through it and come up with at least a solution.\\n\\n- Open to relocating, and open to non-remote. This one is huge. It greatly increased my odds.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nI still have a job, and even if the comp isn\'t the best it\'s still good to live on and build some savings. Despite the stress, this ordeal helped me figure out areas I needed to grow in more and gave me confidence in other regards. I did damn amazing in the LC/technical for only 1 month of studying, and even I couldn\'t believe I got 10/13 callbacks.\\n\\nI\u2019ll do my hunting more casually now. I still do want better comp and a job closer to actual graphics, but prepping for and doing 20+ interviews in the span of 3.5 weeks is god damn misery. Suffered severe mood swings.

Frankly speaking, I dislike LeetCode, but the rules aren\'t set by us and the best we can do is to be better at this stupid game together.\\n\\nHence here are some tips for you.\\n\\n1. Revise your CS fundamentals before your start LeetCoding. You don\'t have to spend that much time studying, but you need to know the advantages of each data structure and when to use which for the question.\\n\\n2. The average question difficulty you\'ll get is Medium. Start with Easy questions, do more of them, move on to Medium questions. You probably won\'t be asked Hard questions in real interviews but you should do some famous Hard questions like Word ladder, serialize/deserialize Binary tree and trapping rain water. You should not be practicing only Easy questions.\\n\\n3. LeetCode is not fully representative of real interviews. In real interviews, you don\'t get long descriptions nor do you get so many test cases. Questions in interviews are intentionally vague and underspecified, you have to clarify the requirements. You will also not be given input ranges during interviews.\\n\\n4. To better simulate interview conditions, come up with a solution in your mind and be sure of the time and space complexity before you start to code. Trial and error-ing during the interview is not seen as a positive signal. As a good habit I write the time and space complexity of my solution as a comment above my solution.\\n\\n5. If you find yourself stuck after half an hour on a question. Determine if you are close enough to cracking it. If you\'re close, try for a while longer. Otherwise read the solutions and move on. Learn the technique that was crucial to solving the question and internalize it. Revisit in a few day\'s time and try to solve it without referring to the answer this time. LeetCode also shows you similar questions for a problem. To test if you have understood the concepts, try the similar questions and see if you can solve them.\\n\\n6. You might not get to run your code during interviews. Interviewers aren\'t just evaluating how correct your code is, the signals you exhibit during the process matters as well. You can end up failing even though you wrote correct code but it\'s messy and not readable. You can also end up passing even if your code had a minor mistake but your code is super clean and well-structured. Getting an Accepted doesn\'t mean you did well if you only got it on your tenth attempt. Before hitting the submit button, scrutinize your solution hard. Come up with test cases, standard ones, edge cases, think whether your code will pass those cases. You can run your code against your own test cases, it\'s still better than hitting the submit button. Just note that you might not get to do that during interviews.\\n\\n7. Some topics are more important than the others. DFS, BFS, binary search, trees, graphs are the most important and common ones. If you\'re going for Google, practice DP. If you suck at DP like me, at least be good at backtracking with memoization.\\n\\n8. The chosen language doesn\'t matter as much as your mastery of the language. You don\'t have to pick up Python just because it\'s the best language for interviews. But if you have enough time (more than two months), it might be worth doing so.\\n\\n\\n9. You don\'t need to practice too many questions. 100-200 is sufficient for most. After a while, the questions are variations of previous questions and are based off the same patterns. The returns on practicing above 300 questions is marginal at best. The full list of 169 questions in Grind 75 (https://grind75.com) is 90% of what you need.\\n\\n10. LeetCoding is a marathon, not a sprint. If you start too early, you run out of steam. Start too late and there\'s not enough time for spaced repetition to take effect. Recommend starting a few months in advance and spending 1hr a day doing a few questions per day. You should be in top shape when it\'s time for interviews. If you\'ve completed all recommended practice questions, do the weekly contests. If you can solve at least 3 of them, you should be ready for interviews.\\n\\n11. You might never feel ready for interviews and that\'s perfectly normal. Interviewing is a numbers game. Interview performance is a function of luck and preparation. The more you prepare, the \\"luckier\\" you get. You will fail some and you will pass some. You just need to pass one.\\n\\nAll the best and lemme know in the comments if you have any questions!","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/uy7gg3/leetcode_tips_from_author_of_blind_75/","datetime":"2022-05-26 18:48:47 IST","votes":1324,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"Tips for a successful internship from a FAANG intern manager","author":"yangshunz","url":"https://reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v0ay2x/tips_for_a_successful_internship_from_a_faang/","subreddit":"csMajors","body":"Having mentored 3 interns who successfully got their return offers, and seen many examples of successful interns at FAANG, here are some tips for your internships which should be useful regardless of company.\\n\\n1) Do what is expected of you. Firstly in order to do what is expected of you, you gotta know what is expected of you. If you\'re a SWE intern, most of the time you just need to finish your project by writing high quality code while not being a jerk. To write high quality code, look at how code is written in the code base and follow the conventions, directory structure, naming, use existing abstractions. Break your code into small PRs so that it\'s easy to review. Nobody likes reviewing PRs which are thousands of lines long. Write tests! At the end of the internship a good litmus test on whether your internship was successful is whether the team would hire you or take their chances with a new intern/fresh grad?\\n\\n2) Demonstrate independence. Your intern manager/mentor/host is also a busy employee and they have their own work to do. If you run into issues, try to unblock yourself first before asking someone. Look up internal documentation, look at existing parts of the code and see if you can follow similar approaches. If you\'re still stuck, then ask. Post in support groups/chats and share your high level goal, the approaches you\'ve tried and why they didn\'t work. This helps people to help you. It\'s ok to ask more questions at the start but the frequency should go down over time.\\n\\n3) Take initiative and ownership of your project. Rather than waiting for tasks to be handed to you, look at the roadmap (or create one if it doesn\'t exist) and keep working on the next item. Break down the project and create tasks for yourself, closing them when completed. Be your own project manager and product manager. Keep a log of the work you\'ve done. This will be super useful if you have to write a self evaluation at the end of your internship.\\n\\n4) Communicate well. You should be the best advocate of your work. In large companies, peer feedback is taken into account for the internship evaluation. Tell your team what you are doing, make occasional updates about your work, give others visibility into your work and demo your work during sprint meetings.\\n\\n5) Take feedback seriously. Your mentor should already be providing you feedback constantly, otherwise, you can always ask. Ask how you can improve and what you can do better. Since you\'ll be spending lots of time writing code, make sure you pay attention to the code review comments you receive and reviewers don\'t make the same comment twice.\\n\\n6) Overdeliver on your project. If you\'re delivering your milestones ahead of time, instead of chilling and sticking to the schedule, finish your project ahead of time. This gives you the opportunity to pursue other things. You can work on stretch goals of your project, think of new ways to improve your project and execute on them. Market your project and get people to use it. Iterate on user feedback.\\n\\n7) Do what is not expected of you. Of course this doesn\'t doing mean negative things. Do things which people don\'t expect interns to be doing. The rockstar interns I\'ve seen, they completed their projects in half the allocated time, had time to help their fellow interns in their work (sometimes even helping full-timers in their work), were added to the team\'s oncall, helped to review the team\'s code, and helped to answer questions from external partners about the team\'s work. Not all of these will be applicable to your situation, but you get the idea. They were functioning and having impact as if they were a full-time team member.\\n\\n8) Assess the company. As much as an internship is a prolonged interview of your fit for the company, it is also a chance for you to interview the company. Do you enjoy the team\'s and company\'s working style? Do they overwork their employees and treat employees with respect? Sometimes interns can be too busy with their projects to pay attention to these things but ultimately these are important factors to take into consideration when deciding whether to sign the return offer. You might not be joining back the same team but the company culture affects the team\'s culture to some extent.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v0ay2x/tips_for_a_successful_internship_from_a_faang/","datetime":"2022-05-29 18:44:17 IST","votes":816,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"What I wish I knew when I started my career as a software engineer","author":"ItsTheWeeBabySeamus","url":"https://reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v6aymn/what_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_started_my_career_as_a/","subreddit":"csMajors","body":"When I got my first job as a software engineer, which I am still grateful to this day that they decided to take a chance on me, I made many mistakes. Most of which were avoidable. After my first job, I was at facebook for 4 years and now I help people study for programming interviews.  I have compiled everything that I have experienced and learned into a post for anyone who is starting out their career or may have experienced the same fuck ups.\\n\\n**Read the stack traces**\\n\\nI cannot tell you the number of times I would ask stupid questions because I couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with my code. I would get stuck and I\u2019d ask the senior engineer on my team for help. He would usually roll over to my desk, look at the stack trace, and read me the answer right off of it\u2026it was just embarrassing.\\n\\nIt was so hard for me to read that block of red text. It felt so intimidating and I just never wanted to do it. BUT as it turns out, reading the stack trace almost always gave me info on what is wrong with my code. If would have just taken the time to read it, I would have saved myself and my team soo much frustration.\\n\\n**Identify where you are uncomfortable and lean into it**\\n\\nIt took me two months to open a JSON file. I didn\u2019t know anything about them and every time they came up at work I would avoid being involved in the conversation. There was some mental block that came up every time I heard someone say \u201ccheck the JSON\u201d file. It wasn\u2019t until I ran into it one day and actually opened it that I realized how fucking simple they were. I still can\u2019t believe it took me that long to even learn what they were.\\n\\nThe real lesson here is that avoiding a topic because it makes me uncomfortable hindered my growth as a software engineer. As they say at Replit: \u201cseek pain\u201d.\\n\\n**Think about the system**\\n\\nAs a junior engineer, I only really thought about the specific files that I was working on. The system was all broken up into pieces in my mind and I never took the time to understand how everything came together. This mindset was fine, but what really allowed me to level up was thinking about the entire system as a whole.  I would write better code and avoiding bugs. Not to mention I became a better communicator with my team.\\n\\n**Avoid Unnecessary refactors**\\n\\nIt was easy to write off my mistakes and inefficiencies by saying things like \u201cthis codebase is a mess\u201d. There was a natural urge to refactor code that I didn\u2019t write. One time, my team spent months working on a complete API rewrite to \u201cclean the codebase\u201d. When we finished, although the code was \u201ccleaner\u201d, nothing measurable had really changed. Management was confused as to why the entire team just spent months rewriting everything to have 0 measurable impacts on the business. I try now to always have a measurable metric that I plan to improve with every major refactor.\\n\\n**Do not Undervalue communication**\\n\\nWhen I was studying for programming interviews, I learned how important it was to be able to talk about my code. I contribute me getting offers at Facebook & Google to my ability to talk through the work that I just did. It was helpful also as I grew to be able to communicate my ideas. As a junior engineer I was just writing code I was assigned. But, as I worked my way up to a senior engineer, I was designing systems and delegating tasks which is where it was important for me to have strong communication skills.\\n\\nOverall, just think a little bit deeper about what you are doing when you start your career. Everything you are doing is apart of a bigger picture. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions (as long as you are positive the answer isn\u2019t in the stack traces). And be confident.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/v6aymn/what_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_started_my_career_as_a/","datetime":"2022-06-07 00:34:52 IST","votes":397,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"How to get remote jobs that pay US/EU salaries in India?","author":"not_so_calm_buddha","url":"https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/x5j96l/how_to_get_remote_jobs_that_pay_useu_salaries_in/","subreddit":"developersIndia","body":"Of late I have been hearing about people working remotely for US/EU companies from India but their salaries are comparable to abroad salaries.

That is a 100% personal choice.\\n\\nWhat I mean by budget is just to say kids are expensive. Include daycare, essential items, insurance, and basically anything else you might be able to think of. Have money in your savings for unexpected expenses. And not just for the child either. Save for unexpected expenses for you and/or your spouce/partner \\n\\nAlso budget more than just money. You\'re going to have to budget time and space. Practical practices can put you in a more practical perspective. Your patience is more likely than not to stretch thinner than your wallet. If you want kids these are things that will have to be sacrificed but as is the nature of sacrifices, things sacrificed will become things gained.\\n\\nBabies also grow up into kids, and kids to teens. You\'ll spend money on different things but you\'ll still be spending it on them. Spending on things you think will be cute or fun that a baby/toddler wont remember and really detail finances when you need that money later in the child\'s life. Your baby is only a baby for so long such as a puppy will eventually grow into a dog.\\n\\nBe prepared to blow your budget. You are a human after all and cant think of everything. However, if this is something you really want to do just know that if you wait until you have enough money to have a child, you\'ll never have a child. Don\'t wait forever, you\'ll get through it.\\n\\nAnd one last thing, depending on the country, there\'s almost always assistance avaible. However, use things as a crutch when you need them, not a prosthetic leg. Food banks are wonderful and many places let babies/ kids in for free under a certain age. My parents actually survived financial drowning because a buffet near by let kids 2 and under eat free, of which my parents had 3 of.\\n\\nThink but dont over think, much love to those with kids and those trying. Love to everyone else too but y\'know I\'m not talking to you lol.\\n\\nEdit 2: \\"if you wait until you have enough money, you\'ll never do it\\" doesnt mean dont need enough to support everybody who you need to. It means that you dont need to have enough money for the child\'s entire life. People are saying that if they had all the money in an account rather than spending it on children that they\'d then have enough money to buy a house. If you have that sort of money, good on ya.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ybgfhz/lpt_if_youre_wanting_to_try_for_a_baby_budgeting/","datetime":"2022-10-23 17:57:14 IST","votes":30418,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Home & Garden"],"archived":false},{"title":"8 ways to develop your career.

It\'s a never-ending subject. And business is an ideal place to put it into practice.\\n\\nBusiness is accelerating, and it\u2019s always in search of growth.\\n\\nIf you suffer from the imposed rhythm, it can quickly become an agony. If you choose to embrace it, you can live exceptional experiences.\\n\\nHow to participate in this adventure while keeping yourself safe?\\n\\nAfter reading more than 300 books on psychology, business, personal development, creativity... and more than 20 years of career where I went from salesman to executive, I would keep these 8 points if I had to summarize.\\n\\n# 1/Be Proactive.\\n\\nAssume 100% responsibility.\\n\\nYou don\'t have all the control, and you probably never will, but simplify the idea and take 100% ownership.\\n\\nYour relationship with your boss isn\'t working. Ask yourself what you could do to improve it?\\n\\nDespite all your efforts, the situation is not improving? What can I do to change the situation? Confront him in a discussion to clear things up, look for another job, talk to his boss...\\n\\n\\"Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.\u201d  \\n\u2015 Viktor E. Frankl\\n\\n# 2/Learn.\\n\\nLearn is your best tool to grow. Develop your ability to learn.\\n\\nNot just the programs offered by the company. But anything that attracts your curiosity and can help both you and your team.\\n\\nReading is a growth booster. And it has helped me tremendously in the professional world.\\n\\nMr. Covey\'s 7 Habits supported me as a salesman and still guides me today as an executive.\\n\\n# 3/Develop your productivity.\\n\\nBecause everything is moving so fast, your organization becomes crucial.\\n\\nWhen we talk about productivity, we often think of applications, techniques, but they are only part of the equation and not the most important.\\n\\nThe 4 essential productivity keys in business\\n\\n**a. Start with the big picture and keep it in mind.**  \\nWhat do you want to do professionally? If everything was possible, what would you do?\\n\\nI still have a mind map I made over 20 years ago. It described my professional options. And at the time, it looked crazy.  \\nGuess what?  \\nI met and exceeded all my expectations. Maybe I should have thought bigger \ud83d\ude00.\\n\\nWhat you do today has nothing to do with what you can become tomorrow.\\n\\n**b. Learn to sleep well.**  \\nProfessional life is exhausting. To be lucid, to make the right choices, you need to be rested and full of energy. Sleep is your best ally. I wish I had understood this earlier.\\n\\n**c. Learn to recover in a hostile environment.**  \\n\\"As soon as I close this project, I\'ll slow down.\\"\\n\\nThere\'s no such thing.\\n\\nThe business doesn\'t slow down. It\'s getting faster and more complex. You must learn to recover in this environment.\\n\\nThe key is to block out time in your schedule only for you and non-negotiable.\\n\\nTime to think or deal with a file alone, play sports at lunchtime, time in the morning to make music, write, walk....\\n\\nIt\u2019s in these moments that you will recover.\\n\\n**d. The one thing that makes or kills your day**\\n\\nDeciding what you will and won\'t do is your most important decision.\\n\\nLearning to follow through (perseverance) and bring your project to the finish line is crucial.\\n\\nWe tend to start a lot and follow few...\\n\\n# 4/Work on your innovation muscle.\\n\\nYou have to change a lot and at the same time persevere. Isn\'t it contradictory?\\n\\nMy way of understanding it:\\n\\nI see a pattern in adopting a flexible mindset in the thought process and a consistent mind when it comes to actions.\\n\\nWe often associate innovation with big projects. But this is far from being the case all the time.\\n\\nTo stand out, innovate every day. Train your muscle.\\n\\nWithout anyone asking you to, regularly brainstorm on improvement topics.\\n\\n* 10 ideas to improve our service meetings that I can share with my boss\\n* 10 ideas to improve the cash collection process\\n* 10 ideas to get more leads....\\n\\n# 5/Learn to write.\\n\\nWrite in your journal to analyze your problems, your emotions, to transform your fears into actions.\\n\\nWrite a handwritten thank you card to a colleague, a client, a partner.\\n\\nWrite to explain before a meeting the critical elements of a project and facilitate the decision-making process for the group.\\n\\n# 6/Welcome your doubts.\\n\\nComplexity creates doubts. Will I be up to the task?\\n\\nDoubt creates fear.\\n\\nFear paralyzes you.\\n\\nReplace that with :\\n\\n* Cut the complexity into small pieces.\\n* And take action.\\n\\nCollect feedback on your first actions and adjust, modify until you find the direction.\\n\\nNext time doubts knock on your door. Welcome them. It\'s not a wrong signal; it\'s a chance to grow.\\n\\n# 7/The habit of extending your comfort zone.\\n\\nA complicated case, a risky promotion, if that\'s what you want to do. Go for it.\\n\\nExpose yourself to risk more often.\\n\\nPractice in everyday life. You\'re afraid to jump from 3 meters at the pool, try it. It\'s a controlled risk (pool with lifeguard \ud83d\ude00 ) in a secured environment.\\n\\n# 8/Develop a hobby/side hustle.\\n\\nThe business is moving fast. What was true yesterday won\u2019t be tomorrow.\\n\\nA merger, an acquisition, a bankruptcy, a drop in result, no matter how good your work is, your situation can change at any time.\\n\\nOr simply a desire on your part to do something else, to give another meaning to your life.\\n\\nDon\'t define yourself only by your position. Find and develop passions besides your main activity. When you find something you like, invest some time.\\n\\nIt allows you to distance yourself from your primary job.\\n\\nAnd maybe one day, you\'ll decide to take the plunge and launch your new idea.\\n\\nMany successful businesses started with a passion. :)\\n\\n# To sum up.\\n\\nLife in the company is challenging, full of complexity, and at the same time exciting. If you have the desire and the energy, you can develop your career, learn a lot and earn a good living.\\n\\nEnjoy the road.  \\n[Mr. OTG](https://optionstogrow.com/tag/grow-your-career/)","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/ycdz5o/8_ways_to_develop_your_career_what_ive_learned_in/","datetime":"2022-10-24 20:49:23 IST","votes":986,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"My Omen 15 has a button that opens the OMEN Gaming Hub, is it possible to change it so that it opens up another (actually useful) app instead (such as Spotify)?","author":"thatdemoniccat","url":"https://reddit.com/r/windows/comments/yd279s/my_omen_15_has_a_button_that_opens_the_omen/","subreddit":"windows","body":"","media":"https://i.redd.it/nkaam2xlqxv91.jpg","datetime":"2022-10-25 16:43:29 IST","votes":402,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["General Question"],"archived":true},{"title":"In your experience, what\'s the biggest woman repellent?","author":"Bonkers_Reee","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ygnj91/in_your_experience_whats_the_biggest_woman/","subreddit":"AskMen","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/ygnj91/in_your_experience_whats_the_biggest_woman/","datetime":"2022-10-29 21:39:05 IST","votes":5306,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"Women of Reddit: you go back to your dates place and seeing this makes you leave immediately.

I posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uj7hnt/is_anyone_noticing_any_sentiment_changes_in_the/) 6 months ago and the responses back then felt like a different lifetime.\\n\\nI can only imagine how many students, junior or even experienced engineers are feeling anxious right now dealing with the first industry downturn in their professional career. After thinking for a few days I think I should pen a post that may help some people around here.\\n\\nSome background about me: I graduated college in the middle of the 2008 recession, but since then I have worked at multiple startups (including one YC and one pre-IPO unicorn), 2 of the FAANG companies, and I helped build a startup that saw a decent exit from acquisition. Until very recently I was in eng leadership position at a medium sized tech company. I\'m also an angel investor on the side and from my network connections I tend to hear whispers and rumors a bit earlier than most people (part of the motivation of why I wrote that earlier post).\\n\\n**Disclaimer**: I will try my best to **not** predict the future in this thread. I want to keep this post as matter-of-fact as possible and I want it to be *descriptive* and if the situation applies, *prescriptive*, but I do not want this post to be *predictive*. I have my thoughts and opinions about the future but I do not want to engage in speculation here.\\n\\nWith all that said, let\'s start.\\n\\n**2 major misconceptions I see a lot around here that I\'d like to address**:\\n\\n1.\\t\\"If I work for a solidly profitable company with a good business model, the recession won\'t impact me\\" -- This is a popular sentiment that usually gets upvoted to the top. There are 2 things wrong with this statement. First is that no companies exist in a vacuum. A company may have a solid business model and good cashflow on its own (eg, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc), but there is no way to guarantee all of their paying customers are in the same shoes, let alone their customers\' customers, etc. That\'s the reason we are seeing all the top companies are giving conservative fiscal outlooks at the moment. Secondly even profitable companies look for reasons to trim fat and cut cost during a downturn. This may start with hiring freezes and may lead to actual layoffs. Different companies do this differently. But just know that leadership do respond to investors and shareholder pressures and sometimes have no choice but to show that they are being fiscally conservative. During the boom time many companies hired people they didn\'t need just so they can tell a *growth story* to investors and Wall Street, but during a down cycle the reverse can also be true. It\'s silly I know, but it\'s what it is.\\n\\n2.\\t\\"Engineers aren\'t going to be impacted\\": It is true that engineers are harder to replace and are considered strategic assets for many true tech companies. But as far as cost saving goes, these are some of the *most* delicious fat to trim since engineers tend to command a larger compensation than other roles. Due to the narrative, PR and morale damage, tech companies tend to be a bit conservative with cutting engineers at the beginning stage of a recession. But if things don\'t get better, cutting engineers *will* be an effective ace-in-the-hole cost cutting measure. Think of it as a \\"nuclear option\\" for growth tech companies.\\n\\nThere are some more but I will move on for now.\\n\\n**Some tips**\\n\\n1.\\tDo Not Panic: I can\'t stress this enough. Do not worry about things that\'s out of your control, like macroeconomics or global events. In times like this, I hate to say it, but the best thing to do is be self-centered and focus on yourself. Take a deep breath and know that most mistakes are made by emotional people. And every single minute you are being emotional is a minute you aren\'t making things better for yourself.\\n\\n2.\\t(Re)Warm Up Your Network: Sometimes it\'s nice to play by your ego. Recession isn\'t one of those times. If you can reasonably reach back out to recruiters that you\'ve ghosted in the past, now may be a good time. You don\'t need to be seriously interested in a job to have them as \\"what-if\\" options. Similarly true for coworkers and ex-coworkers. Good professional relationships go beyond individual companies and sometimes a solid referral is the difference between weeks of job searching and starting a new position 2 weeks after being laid off. \\n\\n3.\\tIncrease Your Visibility: In some situations I mean that *literally*. Like turning on your webcam once in a while in meetings (and try to use webcam in 1 on 1s especially if your manager/lead does it). I know this is a controversial topic on a sub of introverts and people with social anxieties, but just remember that the people who make decisions during layoff are just that... *people*. They fall for some of the most primitive human flaws, emotions and biases. In the boom time people who are more vocal and visible tend to get rewarded more when compared to people of equal technical skills, and in the bust time they tend to...well keep their jobs better. Be visible to your manager *and* to your coworkers. A few junior engineers telling your manager how amazing of a mentor you\'ve been can go very far in your career, whether it\'s promotion or layoff. \\n\\n4.\\tPolish Up Interview Skills: Just do enough to make sure you aren\'t so rusty that you lose confidence. There is no need to spend X hours a day practicing LC unless you think your job security is in imminent risk. It will just unnecessarily stress you out and may even impact your daily job performance, which can lead to unintended consequences.\\n\\n5.\\tFor Graduating Students: Apply to as many places as you can. Keep your expectation realistic. Whatever the type of company you were shooting for 6 months ago, be mentally prepared to accept an offer from a company 1 or 2 tiers below that. It *sucks* I know, but any job on your resume will still be far more valuable than nothing. Edit: Credit to /u/ZhanMing057\'s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yqmrci/winter_may_be_coming_some_high_level_tips_and/ivpgqtk/), grad school is also an option that should be considered by some people.\\n\\n6.\\tKeep a Good Perspective: I am making an exception to the \\"no prediction\\" thing here. If this is your first recession, well it won\'t be the last. But on the other hand the boom time we just saw won\'t be the last one either. These things come in cycles, but the common denominator across booms and busts are *you*, the person. Focus on learning and growth, and there is always opportunities for those even in the worst of the times. And nothing can take your learning and growth away from you. Focus on things you do have, and know that things are never as bad as they look (I tell people the opposite in good times lol).\\n\\n7.\\tIdentify risks and priorities *if* worst case scenario happen, and plan accordingly: Credit to /u/it200219 \'s [comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yqmrci/winter_may_be_coming_some_high_level_tips_and/ivp991a/). \\n\\n**Closing thoughts**\\n\\nLike I said, I can\'t predict the future. I *hope* this post is 100% unnecessary in hindsight (and my investment portfolio hopes so too). And if the recession gets bad, you could end up doing all of the above and still get screwed, or (very likely) do *none* of the above and still end up perfectly fine.\\n\\nBest of luck everyone. I can answer some questions as well.\\n\\nEdit: One related advice: If your company offers VRIF (Voluntary Reduction in Force), *consider* taking it. Some companies would let people volunteer to get laid off, with the same severance packages. The reason I\'m offering this advice is that in a prolonged recession, severance packages get subsequently less generous with latter rounds of layoffs, as the situation becomes more dire. Meta and Stripe\'s first round came with amazing severance packages. By round 3 (if it gets there), I highly doubt it would remain the same.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/yqmrci/winter_may_be_coming_some_high_level_tips_and/","datetime":"2022-11-09 21:22:17 IST","votes":993,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Meta"],"archived":false},{"title":"Is anyone noticing any sentiment changes in the job market?","author":"cookingboy","url":"https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uj7hnt/is_anyone_noticing_any_sentiment_changes_in_the/","subreddit":"cscareerquestions","body":"If you zoom out, we have NASDAQ in freefall and a possible recession on the horizon, \\n\\nIf you zoom into the CS job market, we have started hearing some news that most people on this sub would never have imagined just a year ago.

I know of someone who had a $800k RSU package from Robinhood and it\'s worth literally 1/3 now. I know of Stripe offering very high TC backed by their sky high valuation but the word on the street is that their private valuation is now *half* of what it was at the beginning of last year, and their IPO plans indefinitely delayed.\\n\\nAnyway just trying to take a pulse from this community, these are just some early yellow flags I\'ve noticed and it may or may not continue in this trend.\\n\\n**Edit**: Just heard insider news that Stripe is also going on a hiring freeze for second half of the year. It will become public in the coming days.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/uj7hnt/is_anyone_noticing_any_sentiment_changes_in_the/","datetime":"2022-05-06 02:45:12 IST","votes":311,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"Do you want to simulate a real software engineering job?","author":"sbmsr","url":"https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/yrepyf/do_you_want_to_simulate_a_real_software/","subreddit":"learnprogramming","body":"Hey everyone - I\'m Seb.\\n\\nI am a senior web dev, and I believe there are some core skills required for software engineers that majority of courses generally don\'t dig into.

That\u2019s probably why it only took me 3 days to get my first one. Now, almost a year later, I have over 3+ Lucid dreams a week! So before I tell you the method, you gotta know the basics.\\n\\n**REM PERIOD (Important)**\\n\\nLucid dreams occur in the REM period, so to lucid dream, you have to wake up when your sleep approaches this period. All you have to do is set an alarm 3 hrs 15 mins, 4hrs 30 min, or 6 hrs into your sleep. You can use this chart to get an idea [https://www.youcanluciddream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/sleep\\\\_cycle\\\\_REM\\\\_8\\\\_hour\\\\_graph\\\\_1152.jpg](https://www.youcanluciddream.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/sleep_cycle_REM_8_hour_graph_1152.jpg) \\n\\nREM periods are slightly different for everybody so once you start getting experience, you can start experimenting with alarms to find your REM period.\\n\\n*BIG TIP*: If your alarm wakes you out of a dream or you are very tired when you wake up, you are in your REM period and it should be really easy to enter a lucid dream. \\n\\n*DISCLAIMER*: you can enter a lucid dream without having to wake up in the middle of the night and do it right when you go to bed but hear me out, it is nearly impossible and I hated it. You have to stay still for over an hour and you get distracted and can fall asleep way too easily so don\u2019t do it, especially if you are a beginner. \\n\\n**DREAM RECALL (important)** \\n\\nIf you don\u2019t remember your dreams, there\'s a chance you might forget you had a Lucid Dream. Write down the dreams you remember and slowly your dream recall should increase. This also gives you Vivid dreams. There are many cases where I forgot I had a Lucid Dream and luckily remembered mid-day while doing something that reminded me of it.\\n\\n*TIP*: remember the reason dreams are vivid is because you remember them better, vivid dreams are highly dependant on dream recall.\\n\\n**METHODS (misc but important)**\\n\\nSo chances are this isn\u2019t your first post ever about lucid dreaming and you know what MILD, WILD, DILD, SILD, etc\u2026 are or what they mean. Well, I\'m here to tell you no one cares and essentially Lucid dreaming should be tied into two methods. SILD and WILD. If you don\u2019t know what these are, WILD is (Wake induced Lucid Dreaming) and SILD is (Sleep induced Lucid Dreaming). \\n\\n*DIFFERENCES***:** For SILD, you enter a Lucid Dream through a regular dream. So just imagine that you\u2019re dreaming and then realize \u201cwow I\'m in a dream\u201d, that\'s SILD. SILD dreams are literally wack because they\u2019re so fuzzy and not vivid at all. But WILD is where all the juicy stuff comes into play. WILD is when you enter the dream directly and are aware during the process. This makes your dreams 2000000000000 times more vivid and easier to remember. \\n\\nPeople say that WILD is hard for beginners and don\u2019t recommend it, but I did not care and got it on my 3rd day fam. Lucid dreaming is highly based on intention, which means it\'s as easy as breathing because you can do it naturally. I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I just tell myself \u201cyou know, tonight I feel like lucid dreaming\u201d and I just wake up in the middle of the night and do it without needing a method, it naturally happens at this point.\\n\\nAnyways now that you get the point here how to do it\\n\\n**HOW TO GET A LUCID DREAM TONIGHT**\\n\\nSo once you get your alarm and wake yourself up, consider how long it takes you to fall asleep, you can\'t fall asleep too easily and just end up getting carried off and falling asleep, also you can\'t wake up and just not be able to fall asleep again. So\u2026..\\n\\n**Quick sleepers:** get up and do something. Maybe use the bathroom or read something but DO NOT USE YOUR PHONE, that will definitely mess your sleep and lucid dream up. Don\'t be up for too long or wake yourself up too much, just get ready to fall back asleep fairly easily.\\n\\n**NonSleepy people:** If it\'s hard for you to fall back asleep I have a great method for you because I\'m one of you people. Take your phone and use a calming alarm. Don\u2019t use the mf Radar alarm because that mf will wake up you and your whole neighborhood. Use something calm and *pay close attention to the next thing I say.* You need to turn off your alarm with the LEAST amount of movement possible, so keep your alarm close to your bed. Even better if your alarm has some automatic shutoff function. So basically set a calm alarm that doesn\u2019t scare you awake, which you can turn off with the least amount of movement. Also, try to keep your eyes closed while doing this, it\'ll give you bonus points. \\n\\n**Ok now you are awake:** This is where the juicy stuff comes into play. Lay in a comfortable position, on your right side is the best for me. Also, if you want to get even more vivid dreams, lay on your back. Overall the best position is the position you woke up in, so just lay still. This next part is tricky so bear with me. \\n\\n**TRICKY PART:** The goal is to let your body fall asleep while your mind stays awake. If you are already sleepy you can achieve this really quickly. You gotta relax completely and let every tense muscle go. Every breath you take releases more stress and strain. Imagine yourself falling deeper into your bed after every breath. Try to fall asleep and observe what your body goes through. All this is happening with your eyes closed just in case you didn\u2019t know, so don\'t open your eyes because right now you are trying to \u201cfall asleep\u201d. This next part is kind of hard to explain because unless you experience it, you won\'t know what I mean\\n\\n**HARD TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE YOU NEVER EXPERIENCED IT PART:** So this could go two ways, quickly or kinda slowly, the slow way can take 3-30+ minutes and the quick way can go 0-3 minutes. It just depends on how sleepy you are\\n\\n***Slow way****:* your body will start to numb and soon you won\u2019t be able to feel some parts. It may even feel like some fingers or toes are touching or bent in a certain direction when they are actually not. Your body will feel numb and relaxed. Hard to explain man. Anyways if you reach this part you are \u2153 of the way in. you have successfully relaxed yourself. This next part determines if you will make it through to the dream or not. This is what I like to call the Fermi Boundary. In this \u201cFermi phase\u201d you will feel itches in random places, urges to move, need to swallow your saliva, open your eyes, etc... Well, guess what, DON\u2019T DO IT BRO. Your body is basically trying to see if you are still awake. If you fall into the trap then this whole process restarts and you might as well just go to sleep regularly. Anyways if you pass these tests then you reach the end of the \u201cFermi phase\u201d you\u2019ll know you reached the end because your body will give you the 2 biggest final exam typpa tests ever, boredom and the rollover signal. Boredom means you are really close, trust me. It can take a while in the fermi phase and it gets boring. You can also fall asleep easily so keep your mind busy by doing math and paying attention to your bodily sensations or something. Anyways, The Rollover signal is basically your body giving you a massive urge to roll over, trust me when you first feel it you are like \u201cbruh that\'s all?\u201d but trust me, it might seem small but then the boredom and your mind start tricking you by making you think \u201cyou know what let me just try this another time, I\'m bored and want to sleep\u201d and you roll over. It happened to me so many times it\'s annoying. But once you push through these you get to the most critical stage. \\n\\nThis next stage is where you enter the dream. Remember TRY NOT TO LET YOUR MIND FALL ASLEEP. You\u2019ll get so many random thoughts and it\'s super easy to get carried away, especially if it takes a while. But anyway, there are different things that can happen and the key is to NOT GET TOO EXCITED. You might wake yourself up. At this point, your body is basically asleep and you have achieved the elite \u201cbody asleep mind awake state\u201d. You will feel some things listed below (different for everyone)\\n\\n**Sensations:**\\n\\n\\\\- Heart rate quickens\\n\\n\\\\- Slight headache\\n\\n\\\\- Body buzzing\\n\\n\\\\- Flashing lights behind your eyelids\\n\\n\\\\- Hearing sounds\\n\\n\\\\- Twitches in your body\\n\\n\\\\- Floating feeling\\n\\n\\\\- Ear pops\\n\\n\\\\- Can\'t move\\n\\n\\\\- Feeling like a lead blanket is rising up your body\\n\\n\\\\- Chest feeling tight\\n\\n\\\\- Breathing becomes fast\\n\\nDON\'T GET EXCITED, also if you let your guard down you might fall asleep so be careful. Just acknowledge the sensations and slow down your breathing because this is where the dream begins. \\n\\n**HOW TO ENTER THE DREAMING**\\n\\nThis part is really satisfying so hear me out. You have to imagine yourself rolling out of bed. At this stage, it\'s easy to imagine anything so once you get more advanced you can do cooler things. Anyways when I say imagine, I mean actually feel yourself roll out of bed, remember your eyes are still closed but imagine your room still around you. It may take a couple of tries but just keep trying. Sometimes It feels so real it\'s like I accidentally rolled out of bed.\\n\\nWAIT imma pause here and tell you what would happen if you entered the dream the fast way\\n\\n***Fast way*** So basically the more tired you are the faster it is. But also it\'s harder to keep your mind awake so it requires more willpower and intention to remain conscious. So what would happen is that you completely pass over the \u201cFermi Phase\u201d or just go through it really quickly. Sometimes I wake up before my regular morning alarm so since I am still relatively tired I can fall asleep easily, but I just keep tossing and turning, but if I decide to lucid dream and stay still, I enter the dream really quickly. So the key is to stay still and focused. So as you drift away you immediately start feeling the sensations and then you just continue and roll out of bed.\\n\\n**ROLLING OUT OF BED:** Think of your mind like a GPU or just a game. When you load up a big game or anything, it takes a while for the map and everything to come into focus or \u201crender in\u201d. The dream is similar to this as after you roll out of bed, your bedroom will render in. Dreaming your bedroom is the easiest and best way to Lucid Dream. So after you roll out of bed your eyes are still closed, imagine yourself opening your eyes. Everything should slowly come in. Before your eyes open, you can speed it up by feeling things around you. The more you involve your 5 senses the better your dream and the more vivid it gets. You can touch, smell and hear things. Ngl I sometimes even lick the floor or a wall to make my dream more vivid. \\n\\nTHIS NEXT PART IS CRUCIAL. Everything seems so real you might accidentally dismiss it as real-life so you have to do something called a reality check. You have to check if you are dreaming or not\\n\\n**REALITY CHECKS YOU CAN DO**\\n\\nI recommend doing two or three in case your dream is so vivid that you can\'t tell if it\'s a dream\\n\\n* Poke finger through hands, if it goes through then you are dreaming\\n* Pinch your nose and try to breathe through it, if you can breathe through it you are dreaming\\n* Try to read something, if you can\u2019t, you are dreaming\\n* Bite your tongue, if it doesn\u2019t hurt then you are dreaming\\n* Look in a mirror, this can be scary so make sure you look away quickly. In your dream a mirror doesn\u2019t actually show your true self, your form looks weird and funky, you can sometimes see really scary things, or really weird things, so if you see something strange then you are dreaming.\\n\\nI usually do the \u201cpinching your nose and trying to breathe through\u201d and it works most of the time. Sometimes my dream is so vivid that it doesn\u2019t actually work. In that case, I have to peep the mirror which is kinda scary but you gotta see it through my boy.\\n\\nBy doing reality checks you stabilize the dream and they work wonders, trust.\\n\\nSo by now, you should be in your room in a dream that feels like real life. From here once you get more advanced you can start walking through doors like portals and travel anywhere you want, fly, fight monsters, face your fears, meet anyone, or do anything. **I\u2019ll make future guides** in-depth on how to control your lucid dreams and how to extend them if you want.\\n\\n**TIPS:**\\n\\nTry not to get too excited in your dream, you might wake up by accident\\n\\nTry to focus on your breathing while attempting to let your body fall asleep, if you have any thoughts, acknowledge them and just let them pass. Be Careful or you may get too carried away and fall asleep\\n\\nWhen you enter the body asleep and mind awake state, just focus on rolling out of bed into your room, if you lose your focus you can fall asleep or get stuck into sleep paralysis. If this happens do not panic, just keep your eyes shut. I\'ll drop another guide for what to do. Sleep paralysis ain\'t even bad unless you think scary things.\\n\\nThe sleepier you are, the quicker you can enter a lucid dream, but it\'s also easier to accidentally fall asleep.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions and I might respond with future posts.\\n\\n**ALSO Should I make a Youtube Channel?**","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/p6i6qp/how_to_lucid_dream_tonight/","datetime":"2021-08-18 07:57:54 IST","votes":11283,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Success!"],"archived":false},{"title":"What\'s the biggest \\"Green Flag\\" that could be misinterpreted as a \\"Red Flag\\"?","author":"ShareFlat4478","url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18g0mqh/whats_the_biggest_green_flag_that_could_be/","subreddit":"AskReddit","body":"","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/18g0mqh/whats_the_biggest_green_flag_that_could_be/","datetime":"2023-12-12 00:10:51 IST","votes":9740,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"A cool guide to traditional North Indian Familial Titles","author":"Starbucks__Lovers","url":"https://reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/17yp3he/a_cool_guide_to_traditional_north_indian_familial/","subreddit":"coolguides","body":"","media":"https://i.redd.it/uqmwrbywg81c1.jpg","datetime":"2023-11-19 10:07:03 IST","votes":1047,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"Add Your Boy Math In The Comments!!","author":"LackPsychological724","url":"https://reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/171r3st/add_your_boy_math_in_the_comments/","subreddit":"TwoXIndia","body":"1.

Some people had strongly disliked it previously because I used some analogies as a defense mechanism to exclude women from this discussion. I have now removed those analogies.\\n\\nThis gonna be so long because some of the guys here needs spoon feeding. Even their basics are not cleared, they just keep sending chessy and creepy pickup lines to women everywhere.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*This is a guide for men who get matches and gets failed to captalize them. So if you dont get matches change your pics(no selfies and take a professional help), prompts, bio, hairstyle, clothing style, lift some weights at gym. Just invest on yourself then start again with this guide. Also delete all other apps and just use hinge and bumble\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThese guidelines are not rigid, so you could be more flexible with them. It\'s an artistic endeavor rather than a scientific one.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1. \\\\*\\\\*CHANGE YOUR MINDSET\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMost of the time, your mindset is the problem. Step out of your Bollywood mindset that doing everything right will make a woman accept you in the end. That\'s not true; nobody owes you anything here. You need to earn it rather than just hope or beg for it. There are X number of girls in the universe, and among those X girls, Y number of girls will be attracted to you. You will be attracted to some of the Y girls. So the key to finding Y girls among X is just 3 seconds. It takes only 3 seconds to approach a woman. You just need to gather the courage and strike up the conversation confidently to know if she\'s an X or Y. It\'s okay to be rejected, and it\'s not okay to continue after rejection. Women have 999+ types for men. I have seen \\"questionable creatures\\" dating perfect 10 models. So physical attraction is not everything, and a pretty woman is not a scarce commodity. It\'s wrong to assume that a hot girl won\'t like your average-looking face, or an unattractive girl will automatically find you attractive.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\"Fear of rejection\\" is the biggest obstacle in your path. It only stops you from growing. We suffer more in our imagination than in real life. The more you approach women, the more this fear will diminish.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2. \\\\*\\\\*BE STOIC AND NOT A DESPERATE OR CREEP\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOkay, this may sound too basic and repetitive, but it\'s not. Some of you guys need to understand that no woman wants to hear about your sexual fantasies or creepy pickup lines. Not to objectify anyone, but you don\'t kiss an alligator while you\'re in its territory. The moment it finds you lacking and weak, it will consume you. The same thing happens with women too. The moment you show them you\'re desperate or weak for them, your chances will get slimmed as hell. That\'s why stoic and emotionally unavailable men rule most women\'s hearts.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReference: \\\\[Video Link\\\\]([https://youtu.be/EFkyxzJtiv4](https://youtu.be/EFkyxzJtiv4)) - This video will help you more than enough.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n3.\\\\*\\\\*BE FUN AND FLIRTY\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWomen will fight for you in their group chats if guys are funny. Humor is a god-given talent, but you can certainly learn it. Hard work beats talent. Flirting is a man\'s best arsenal against the friend zone. Although flirting is hard to master, it surely comes with a risk. Flirting should be more platonic and indirect. Flirting should be natural, and it does not mean complimenting the women directly. Say a big \\"No\\" to pick-up lines until they fit like a glove in the conversation. You just can\'t unleash your hormones in the name of flirting.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReference: Watch Craig Ferguson, Russell Brand, and Paul  interview videos on YouTube.

It\'s just so unattractive. Unless she\'s trying to roast you or offend you, please avoid attacking her in any way. Playful roasting may work wonders. Always try to be welcoming and caring (not excessively like a simp). Be the reason for her to open the app. Also, try not to be judgmental, for heaven\'s sake. Colorful hair colors, piercings, or a sexually active life are not red flags. Women don\'t dislike anyone more than quick judgmental people. No person is perfect alone, but together we could be perfect for each other by filling each other\'s voids.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n5. \\\\*\\\\*DONT BE BANAL\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTexting a woman is akin to playing chess. A clever opening, avoiding blunders, and making excellent moves are all it takes to secure a date. Always wait for her to text first for a few hours and take your time to reply to her. As soon as the conversation and her interest start building, transition away from the dating app to iMessage or WhatsApp. Instagram works too but should be used sparingly. Try not to engage in a conversation like an interview; instead, encourage her to share more about herself. NEVER bombard her with excessively long texts about yourself or cheesy lines. Focus on topics like her music interests, pets, or her friends.\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReference: [https://youtube.com/@Charismaoncommand?si=5lGreycaZdmmH3\\\\_D](https://youtube.com/@Charismaoncommand?si=5lGreycaZdmmH3_D) \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n6.\\\\*\\\\*DONT BE A NICE GUY\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDon\'t be too nice, or you\'ll end up getting treated like a doormat. If you believe that being overly kind or speaking softly will earn you affection, think again. She won\'t even bother to acknowledge you, let alone give you a chance. Being overly \'nice\' is a red flag in the eyes of many women. They may assume that nice guys are only being nice to them because they wanna get laid in return, so they tend to avoid them like the plague.\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nReference:[https://youtu.be/rCVAC8Iw3I8?si=TI4m3QhWgmZ8je1I](https://youtu.be/rCVAC8Iw3I8?si=TI4m3QhWgmZ8je1I)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n7. \\\\*\\\\*GROOM YOURSELF, MAINTAIN YOUR HYGIENE AND DRESS PROPERLY\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/chiragbarjatyaa/status/1518231712903303168?t=Xm2fRalzm2HYcr664ywu9g&s=19](https://twitter.com/chiragbarjatyaa/status/1518231712903303168?t=Xm2fRalzm2HYcr664ywu9g&s=19)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwWEn3yqpCO/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwWEn3yqpCO/?igshid=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThese two guides will be of help to you.

It gave me a good idea about the job market and helped me be less scared about the whole affair. It\'s this one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details\\\\_walkthrough\\\\_of\\\\_my\\\\_recent\\\\_job\\\\_hunt\\\\_coming/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details_walkthrough_of_my_recent_job_hunt_coming/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n\\nSo, anyway I wanted to make a post about my recent switch too and maybe help someone in the process. \\n\\nDetails:\\n\\n* Total experience: 5.5 y (Non-tech 1y3m and Tech 4y2m)\\n* Old CTC: 6 LPA\\n* New CTC: 18 LPA (90% fixed, 10% variable)\\n* Resignation date: 27th May and LWD: 28th August\\n* Preparation start date: 20th May (I think)\\n\\n* New company joining date: 13th Sept\\n\\n\\nWalk through:\\n\\nI had been working as a QA Engineer for around 4 years(Internship+Permanent Employee). C#, Selenium, MSTest with Hybrid Driven Development Framework. I got tired of my job and felt like I had stagnated. I knew that it was a terrible time to switch but I felt like I had hit a wall in my job and wanted a change. I started applying but most companies would not accept a 3 month notice period. So, I put down my resignation without an offer in hand(Please don\'t do this, I was going through something in my personal life too and would not suggest someone else to do the same). \\n\\nI definitely needed more time to study, I think I wasted 5-6 interviews which could have gone better in the starting two months of my resignation period. Did not get a lot of calls during that time as most companies needed immediate to 15 days joiners. \\n\\nIn the third month of my resignation period, I got a lot of calls and gave around 35+ rounds of interviews from 15+ companies. \\n\\nOne of the good things I did was I recorded almost every interview so I could come back later and review the questions that had been asked and prepare them well. Interviewers don\'t have much time. You need to be crisp and concise in your answers. No one needs to know a 5 minute speech about the difference between interfaces and abstract classes. Just say the two most important points and you\'re good.\\n\\nI created accounts on Naukri, Wellfound, Linkedin, Indeed. But I only got calls from Naukri. \\n\\nMy mistake was that I was not prepared in giving interviews. The way to answer questions, the way to communicate with the interviewer, all of that. And there were so many instances that the questions were being repeated in different interviews but I hadn\'t prepared well so I lost interviews which could have been salvaged. \\n\\nThe last week of August was action packed as I gave and cleared almost all the interviews I appeared in. I had specifically mentioned that I was an immediate joined but would later tell the HR that I would join on 15th September basically making the excuse that I need to go to my home town before joining the company. Obviously the company is going to push you to join asap. But if you are confident that you can get counter offers, you should ask them to wait.\\n\\nIn the end I ended up getting offers of 14 LPA (which they increased to 17.7 and later 18 lpa), 16 lpa, 17 lpa. I basically had counter offers due to which the companies ended up increasing their initial offers. The companies will always low-ball you, it\'s your job to advocate for your self.\\n\\nI was not expecting my salary to bump up that much. I was hoping for maybe 12 LPA but definitely not 18.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n* Keep your resume short.\\n* If applying on Naukri, update your profile everyday\\n* Practice answering the questions out loud. You could record yourself on a webcam answering questions.\\n* Record your interviews and review the questions later on.\\n* Go through most asked questions on google fitting your profile. The interviewers most of the time are looking through the same set of questions.\\n* Maybe practice a bit of DSA. There\'s a few list of string related DSA questions that you can check from Google.\\n\\nAnyway I have been meaning to write this post for a few weeks now and I finally got around to writing it. I am sorry if it\'s not structured well. I thought I should post it instead of making it perfect. If you have any questions I will be pleased to help.\\n\\nThings I would do from now on:\\n1. Give interviews even if I have no intention of switching my company. At the moment I am planning to do it once every quarter. It gives a better understanding of the kind of questions being asked by the companies and also helps you be in practice. \\n2. Learn my tech stack in depth BUT learning basics of relevant technologies - breadth instead of depth. Like I am a QA, need to understand in depth of things related to QA but I should also know the basics of networking, sockets, tcp, ssh connections, Java script. It will only help me get a better perspective to work on my profile. \\n3. If I am learning something, need to publish articles on medium and lowkey advertise on linkedin. We make the mistake of starting our job search when we are fed up with our current job. But if we are constantly improving ourself and telling the world too(making linkedin articles, publishing on medium) then the opportunity will come to you. Think about it. \\n\\ntldr: got a 200% hike working as qa engineer walk through and tips\\n\\nEdit 1: Additional details.\\nEdit 2: more advice added","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/16y3vla/walk_through_of_my_recent_job_switch/","datetime":"2023-10-02 23:43:01 IST","votes":197,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Career"],"archived":true},{"title":"Details / walkthrough of my recent job hunt, coming off a break to getting my first offer","author":"overgrownGrimace","url":"https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/149x7dj/details_walkthrough_of_my_recent_job_hunt_coming/","subreddit":"developersIndia","body":"Hey devs! So, I\'ve always loved this sub, and I can see and sense all the frustrations of people searching for jobs, and especially in this market, it\'s tough, it really is. I recently went through it myself so I\'m just putting up my process and journey out here, just in case some or any of you can find it helpful. I\'ll try and be as detailed as I can, but I won\'t be addressing anything that might even remotely reveal my idenitity, so believe this if you want but I\'m not providing any sort of \'proof\', take my word, or don\'t.\\n\\nAll applications were for a frontend developer job with around 2 YOE and with react as a mandatory requirement (for me, I didnt want to work with angular, vue etc), average range would 12-18 L, location - either bangalore or fully remote, didnt apply for any other city.\\n\\nImportant numbers / dates -\\n\\n* Old CTC - 13\\n* New CTC - 16L plus ESOPs - I know its not a big bump but I\'m very happy with it.\\n* Old job left on Nov 2022\\n* Time spent being on a break - 6 months, nov-april, where I didn\'t touch code or try to interview or prepare for interviews.\\n* Job search started - May 2nd\\n* First offer (taken) - June 14 - around 40 days from start to finish\\n* Applications on wellfound \\\\- 80 , heard back from 9, 1 went to offer\\n* Applications on linkedin \\\\- 30, heard back from 1 (after premium inmessage)\\n* Applications on instahyre  \\\\- 100, heard back from 4 ( I rejected them all as they were all too far for me, commute was 3+ hours)\\n* Applications on cutshort\\\\- \\\\~50 (mixture of them reaching out and me applying), heard back from 3\\n* Applications on career websites - 22 (emails sent from me to careers@companyx etc), heard back from 1 (this is the offer I ended up taking)\\n* Applications on other career sites (pyjama hr, workday etc) - \\\\~20, dont have an exact number for this, around 20 I guess, heard back from 0;\\n* Take home assignments - 4, average time taken around 4-5 hours, 2 of these seenzoned me, 1 I left now because I already had an offer and wasnt interested further, 1 of them was the one that led to offer#2\\n* Online assessments - 3, failed 2 and passed 1, the passed company just stalled me and the process never went anywhere, even after 2 weeks they were just asking for more time.\\n* Face to face interviews - 19, this is the total meetings, including intro calls, etc from google calendar.\\n* Face to face tech or tech-related interviews - 13\\n* Bombed interviews - 3\\n* Timeline for offer #1 (taken) - Call #1 intro call -> Call #2 tech round -> Call #3 with PM -> Call #4 with CTO, offer rolled out on the same day.\\n* Timeline for offer #2 (not taken, but would have if #1 didnt exist) - Take home assignment -> Call #1 Tech round -> Call #3 CTO round -> Offer after 8 days - This company took too long, step 1 and 2 had 3 weeks b/w them, if they had been quicker I\'d have been working there right now lol.\\n\\nI\'ve listed all the sites already but heres how I would rank them, just my experience, your mileage may vary -\\n\\n1. Wellfound  \\\\- best for startups, 1-100 teams, good UI, has recently processed flag so you can tell which companies are active. Got the highest hit-rate here. Biggest con would be lack of good filters for INR and search and filter algos are out of whack most of the time.\\n2. Career sites of companies - this is still the best way to things IMO, even though I received only 1 callback ( that did turn into the offer I\'d take), I still think for early stage startups this is the best way to reach out, if you see an opening anywhere else, just go to the website, find their careers page/hr and email them, or linkedin message the HR/founder.\\n3. Instahyre/cutshort - both are a draw, instahyre got me a few calls, but not for the companies I wanted, cutshort got me 3 good interviews but I screwed up 2 and the other is just stalled. Both the UIs are not great and esplly cutshort is very annoying to use. Instahyre\'s algorithm for matching jobs is very weird and it ranks you very low if you apply for a job it thinks you\'re not a good fit for, even when the JD feels like a great fit.\\n4. LinkedIn - horrible, every new new job would have 100+ applicants within an hour, if I\'m lucky, it could even be 1000+, none of my linkedin connects were any help, recruiters who were calling me for interviews before wouldnt even reply now, leaving me on seenzone lol honestly hate linkedin these days. Glad I dont have to go there anymore now.\\n5. Didnt use - indeed, naukri. Why? Felt it was too crowded, and few startups and salary ranges were low and expectations were sky high.\\n\\nWhy I got as many callbacks as I did (my thoughts, I\'m not an expert or anything)\\n\\n1. Simple resume - I used [flowcv](https://app.flowcv.com/) to make my resume, it was much less than 1 page, it was very very simple, clean and easy to read.\\n2. Writing a custom CV for every application, without any AI, would spend 4-5 mins on their website, their JD, and try to customize it as much as possible. Nothing fancy or anything, just highlight keywords, skills, experience. Add a custom sentence about how I\'ll fit in well there, either culturally, with skills or whatever. Highlight unique things about you that might interest them, for me, it was immediate joining, no notice period is a good thing for small startups.\\n3. Follow up with people on their linkedin - after 7-9 days if I didnt get a response from a job I wanted, Id find their linkedin and message them there, this has given me 2-3 responses on wellfound i.e they\'ve replied on wellfound after I\'ve messaged them on linkedin.\\n4. Know your target companies, its not the JD that matters, its the people that are hiring and the kind of people they hire. Offer#1 said I need 3 YOE, which I definitely dont have, but I applied anyway, and here we are. Some companies are strict about these things, some aren\'t, you can sort of tell from their JD, glassdoor, linkedin etc.\\n5. I would only apply for companies that had good glassdoor ratings OR had a good culture/about page, this increased my chances of getting shortlisted because they have something to lose by not keeping up their responses and they might actually be decent people. I never applied for any company with glassdoor rating lower than 4.\\n6. No spam, I only applied for where I would join, so I always had some interest to follow up, send a proper CV and stay invested, not just click apply and forget it.\\n\\nMisteps -\\n\\n1. Being unprepared - BIG MISTAKE. BIG BIG MISTAKE. I started applying immediately after my break without any prep, and suddenly got a very good interview 4 days in and bombed it. If I didnt, I probably could have gotten a better package AND wouldn\'t have to suffer this stress for another 30+ days. FFS I curse myself everyday. Imagine getting a job the first week, it would have been amazing. Damn.\\n2. Too much leetcode - Yes, leetcode is important, but for my role - Frontend, leetcode was minimal at startups, the very basic ones, easy mostly, they\'re important for online assessments thats bout it, wasted around a week trying to grind leetcode and I still couldnt understand anything and it never was an issue in interviews. THIS IS NOT TO SAY YOU DONT NEED GOOD DSA SKILLS. Basics like array manipulation, recursion, Dp are IMPORTANT. But mostly it was a combination of react with DSA instead of leetcode. Ex - render a component with a data object with n children.\\n3. Building a portfolio project - built something with typescript and next.js hoping it will help me stand out, but nobody cared or asked about it, or if they did, they never told me, took 1 week, probably a waste of time, if you\'re an experienced dev, wouldnt bother, if you\'re a fresher this is very important.\\n4. Scheduling multiple interviews in a day - I was in a hurry so I scheduled multiple calls in the same day, and it was bad, one of them went over by 40 mins and then i was tired and didnt do the next one very well. Thankfully I wasnt very into it but yeah, try and avoid this, or schedule them a lot of time apart.\\n\\nOverall some tips from me from what has worked for me -\\n\\n* Keep your resume simple, keep your cv simple, avoid AI, avoid spamming if you can.\\n* Know your targets, culturally, ctc wise and tech wise.\\n* Keep a number in your mind while negotiating but never say it firmly if you\'re truly interested, always say there\'s room for negotiation (if you\'re desperate for a job, otherwise, go for it)\\n* For javascript and frontend specifically be very thorough on these topics  \\nClosures, this object, prototype, events, event loop, callstack, let, var, const, basic OOP, css flex/grid, react virtual dom, why vdom, why react, what and how does diffing work. And practice gotcha questions and output based questions too, some of them ask random stuff. [react questions](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions), [js questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions)\\n* For DSA - neetcode 75, should be okay for my range at least, more than problems understand the logic and be sure to communicate in interviews. In offer#1 I couldnt complete my tech assessment in time but they said I communicated it well enough that they were okay moving me up.\\n* Be in a calm environment, drink some water during interviews. They\'re also just devs, try and be yourself, be casual, try and build a rapport, talk a lot and think more, code only when you\'re sure.\\n* BE CAREFUL OF ONLINE ASSESSMENT PLATFORMS - so i failed 2 of my online tests, and I went to that platform and took a demo test and it would tell me I was cheating (eyes away, switched tabs, etc) even when I wasnt, be very careful and try and be facing the camera as much as possible and dont hit accidental keys lol.\\n* If you get a take-home assignment, really weigh the benefits of doing it, if it takes a lot of time. 2 of my assignments ghosted me and I put significant time into it :(\\n\\nClosing thoughts -\\n\\nI rejected around 5-6 companies because of their strict wfo policy, or their office was very far from where I live (3h+ daily commute) IDK if they would have turned into offers, I was hopeful for one, the rest probably not. Nobody cared that I was on a break, I was only asked about it once and even they said it\'s fine, and personally it was a huge thing for me.Actually most of the tech people thought I was still at my last job, just goes to show that they dont really read resumes properly lol.\\n\\nGetting the initial call/email was the hardest, after callback/email, all the companies and recruiters I\'ve talked to have been wonderful, I\'ve learnt a lot about interviews, tech, companies and people in general. Everyone genuinely seemed like they wanted to help and I didnt come across any hostile or egoistic engineer or cto or recruiter either, they were all very cool, some of them reached out after I declined their offer/round and gave me their number for next time, 10/10 wholesome.\\n\\nThe past month was very stressful, my hairfall got exponentially worse and I had stress headaches too, but I never stopped trying, kept applying, and I never reduced my expected ctc, reaching out etc. I know a lot of you went through much worse, hang in there. Shout out to my family and friends, who were always supportive and never once doubted me. I did calm down after the first 3 weeks, and got more focused and less stressed but yeah, not a fun time. It almost reversed all the fun I had in my break.\\n\\nFinally, this might be a very bitter or harsh thing to say, and if you wanna downvote me, go ahead, but there are jobs, there are companies, lots of them, most of the companies I interviewed said they\'re having a hard time finding good candidates, if you\'re not getting callbacks, it\'s not the market, yes, its relatively bad right now, especially for freshers, but you still can get a job.\\n\\nIt\'s either your skills, your resume, your way of reaching out, your job platform or a combination of all of those. Finding a job is a skill in itself. It is. Blind applying on linkedin, grinding leetcode and crying about it to my network wont do jack shit for me. If you\'re 1/20000 applicants, you\'re getting nowhere. Know where you can apply to maximize your odds, hopefully this post helps with that.\\n\\nHaving said that, hiring is broken in India, it really is, so don\'t be too hard on yourself, its fucked up on both sides. But that\'s the reality, you have to function within that, find ways to beat the system, whatever that is.\\n\\nSorry if this is too long or too short, I didnt really structure this well, like I\'m lazy and I\'m tired but I wanted to make this just in case it helped someone, so if you have any questions please ask here in the comments so it can be helpful for others as well, but like I said, I\'m not giving any personal info about any of this. Pls don\'t send me your resumes, if you want me to review them, make an anonymous version (remove all personal info) and share that, I\'ll try to give my inputs.\\n\\nPutting \\"Not looking\\" into all these websites was the best feeling haha.\\n\\nI hope this was helpful, I\'m too lazy to do that data flow thingy and all, all these numbers are approx from me literally counting them lol, but yeah general picture, I\'ve tried to be as transparent as I can be. I truly hope you find your job soon if you\'re looking, it\'s really hell to be in that position, hang in there, keep going, you\'ll get there.

I have been watching the posts at r/developersindia since at least two years. I do comment and partake in discussions as well using another ID. Before I proceed, let me first introduce myself.\\n\\nI am [Vaibhav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaibhavkaushal/), a middle-aged (35+ yrs old) man working in the IT industry since 10+ years (but doing software development since more than 14 years now). I have been a FullStack (Web+Backend) + DevOps guy since the beginning but am mostly backend-heavy these days. In the past I have written for a few Tech Magazines which includes Digit, CHIP and Linux for You. I started the journey with the security domain so I do have some basic knowledge around that too. I have been one of the core developers of a PHP framework in the past (named QCubed) which has been used at NASA, Stanford School of Medicine and was the framework in which the world\u2019s largest Chess community site (Chess.com) was originally written.\\n\\nNow, back to the point. One of the most (if not THE most) frequently asked questions on this sub is about how to get into a job (aka \\"how to crack the interview\\"). I have been taking interviews since the start of career (10+ years) and have been on both sides of the table. So I believe I am qualified to offer some insight into the process and offer help on this topic.\\n\\nMost people think Leetcode is THE DEFINITIVE ANSWER. Sorry to state but that\'s NOT TRUE. I have worked with a couple of guys who were champions in competitive coding and honestly they were bad with everything else and that\'s a huge problem. Now Leetcode (or similar sites) are useful in training your mind to think in better ways. They teach you to think in innovative ways and make you proficient in basics of DSA. But honestly, in my career so far I never had to write a merge sort or invert a tree; never.\\n\\nSo what do people look for in candidates? Unless you are trying for MMAANG, where DSA skills is mostly a filtering mechanism, you don\'t need the god level expertise with DSA. What impresses me (and a lot of other guys taking interviews) is \\"experience\\".\\n\\nSo now you must be thinking \\"but I need a job or at least a meaningful internship to get experience\\". And that\'s where most people, at least in my observation on this sub, are wrong.\\n\\nWhen we look for candidates, we look for people who can solve problems in innovative ways; people who have the ability to go deep into a subject and find out why a bug exists; someone who already knows how to handle git; a guy who knows that part of the job of writing the software is to read other people\'s code and understand why something was done in a certain way; someone who understands that documentation is pretty important. I expect him to know the basics of the environment where his code will work (browsers for FE, Kubernetes/Cloud/VM for BE) and so on, what it will interact with (REST APIs, gRPC, GraphQL, Auth mechanisms for FE and DB, Cache, Logging frameworks etc. for BE).\\n\\nNONE of that needs you to have an internship or job. If someone has put up a profile with some experience with an existing Open Source project or has built something cool that solves a real problem, it catches my eye. Regardless of other factors, the desire of me wanting to talk to him is pretty high.\\n\\nNow, if you built a Library management system (or something similar) using 10 files in Python, I am sure no one is using that and such software are already there. You have zero visibility into how many use-cases are lacking, what the real-world bugs are in the code and so on. It probably cannot handle enough traffic and is organised poorly. So basically I am looking for \\"meaningful work\\" - whether you contributed a small feature or fixed a bug in Kubernetes or made a Logging library which is super easy to integrate and use, you are experienced with the domain in a meaningful way. You\\n\\n- must have some insight into code organisation\\n- must be knowing fundamentals of git\\n- must be knowing how to structure to your code\\n- must have decent communication skills\\n- must have read through and understood basic documentation related to the subject\\n- must be (very important) passionate about solving an existing problem\\n\\nAll of this is \\"experience\\" that makes my life easy as a senior/lead developer. It tells me that you, as a junior/colleague, would not need hand holding on basic stuff and that I can count on you to understand the dozens of dependencies on existing codebase and its functionality. Of course it does not mean that you should skip on DSA or that DSA is useless! DSA is still very much required, although being a DSA god is not required for most things we do in the software world!\\n\\nNow, I have had a few ideas since quite some time and recently I came in touch with a few members of this sub and started collaborating on those ideas. A couple of those are being actively developed.\\n\\nOne of them is a developer tools utility and is accessible at https://devta.techrail.in (apologies, site might be down as I am working on the server to dockerize all apps for portability). It is like DevUtils (https://devutils.com/) but is a web-app (loads in the browser) and does all calculations on the browser itself. It does not (and must not in future) send any data to any backend to get the stuff done. It is a work in progress but 8 out of 10 tools developed so far are working flawlessly.\\n\\nAnother is a project for an open source password manager (like LastPass or Bitwarden, but open source) which uses the user\u2019s Google Drive to store and sync the passwords. It does not have a backend and is not supposed to have one. We are starting work on the iOS mobile app and have initialized the Android app too. We are going to need the Browser Extensions in future as well. Here is a screenshot from an earlier build (we have the mocks ready).\\n\\nIn addition we have some backend-focused projects planned as well - from logging library to file server to proxy projects. We are a small bunch (this includes u/3649RIO, u/computermakeswaffle, u/Agent474real and others) but we are chugging along; improving our profiles while also solving some problems that exist.\\n\\nMy career got a kickstart despite being a college dropout because of my open source contribution profile and I think it is something that matters a lot (having been on both sides I can attest to that). I hope at least some of you would understand this point.\\n\\nWe have a discord server where we discuss/chat about the work (and sometimes share memes too), hold a discussion every weekday at 9 PM to share our progress across projects and share and learn things from one another. So if you are interested in working on some meaningful open-source projects (for improving the profile and gaining experience), you can join our discord and we can talk about what interests you and start off with a relevant project. GitHub org link is https://github.com/techrail \\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I don\u2019t plan to create an Instagram/Facebook page, Twitter handle or SubReddit for this. All we have is the Discord server for discussions specific to the projects/apps we want to build. It is not a place for getting generic help around coding, or resume reviews or leetcode hints (for that you have r/developersindia and its discord server). Our Discord server is focused on the Open Source development work on the selected projects, so please join only if you are interested in doing the development/testing work.\\n\\nEDIT: A number of you joined. The post has gained more popularity than I anticipated. It only shows that most of us want to do something but don\u2019t know where to start and/or what to do. Those of you who have joined and want more details - I will try to post some readmes, create channels and repositories and categorise stuff. Please join the daily call in the evening (9PM).

This is definitely a dying art and I figured I\u2019d spread the knowledge to keep it alive! If anyone has ever wanted to learn how to do that piercing two finger whistle, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide.\\n\\nLet me know how it goes! And if anyone else can already do this, feel free to comment as well.\\n\\nStep One: cover your lips over your teeth. You don\u2019t want there to be a ton of overlap as it can interfere with the ability to create a sound.\\n\\nStep Two: take your thumb and index finger on one of your hands and make an okay sign, make sure that these two fingers are touching.\\n\\nStep Three: this is the most important part of the technique. Take your two fingers and have them up pointing slightly upwards. Stick your tongue out and place your fingers right below the tip of your tongue. As you put your tongue back in your mouth, make sure that it folds backwards. It doesn\u2019t have to be folded exactly in half but it must fold back and make sure that your folded back tongue is pressed up against itself. Also make sure that there is a hole for the air to come out when you blow, which produces the whistle.\\n\\nStep Four: make sure that your lower jaw is slightly in front of your upper jaw and blow. Another tip is to make sure that your tongue is bunched up and is applying pressure to your fingers as you do it. \\n\\nIt takes some time to find the sweet spot so keep at it. I hope these instructions aren\u2019t confusing, I tried to be as detailed as possible because I\u2019ve seen other posts and videos on this subject that are way too general, especially regarding the third step.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/158g465/lpt_how_to_master_the_two_finger_whistle/","datetime":"2023-07-24 22:22:18 IST","votes":19609,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Miscellaneous"],"archived":false},{"title":"Comprehensive list of good companies for SDE 1 and SDE 2.","author":"Geekstein","url":"https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/155b7hl/comprehensive_list_of_good_companies_for_sde_1/","subreddit":"developersIndia","body":"Hi everyone, below is a list of companies which I have gathered from various sources like leetcode posts, reddit posts, glassdoor, twitter, LinkedIn posts etc.\\n\\nThese companies pay **12L+ base to SDE 1**s and most of them pay **23L+ base to SDE 2**s.\\n\\nAlso, **\'good\' in the title actually means good paying only**.

Because of my work and general lifestyle, I have had to move many times (6 big moves to 6 different cities in three different countries on two different continents). I\'ve never made friends easily but have a very profound need for meaningful human interactions, so I easily fall into the trap of loneliness, especially when I was out of school and in the work world.\\n\\nThis is what has worked for me and others I have advised. I have also witnessed way too many other people making these mistakes.\\n\\n**The best way to stop being lonely is to act like someone who isn\'t lonely.**\\n\\nA sad truth of life is that, often, nothing is a bigger social repellant than loneliness. People don\'t want to take on your emotional baggage when they barely know you. And people don\'t want to feel like they are interesting to you purely based on the fact that they are better than nothing.  \\n\\nSo you need to get out there and meet people, but as if you already have a basically completely full life and are willing to make some space for them. Below I go into more about how to make sure you genuinely have this full life. \\n\\nWhen people are friendly to you and make overtures, say yes, but don\'t overdo it. These overtures likely mean they are somewhat interested in getting to know you better, not in interviewing you to immediately to be their new best friend or love of their life. *Remind yourself to take things slow*.\\n\\n*Some examples of acting lonely when you meet someone new you:*\\n\\n(1) Want to become too serious as friends or romantic relationships too quickly. Generally latching on to anyone being nice.\\n\\n(2) Overshare personal information.\\n\\n(3) Complain about how people are jerks and don\'t appreciate you.\\n\\n(4) Complain about ex-partners or ex-friends.\\n\\n(5) Complain about lack of dates or friends.\\n\\n(6) Use too much self-deprecating humor, or generally talk about yourself in a negative way.\\n\\n(7) Act like a doormat so people will like you more.\\n\\n(8) Act like an emotional void, listening to them all the time without contributing to the conversation, doing whatever other people want.\\n\\n*Other behaviors:*\\n\\n(1) Habitually over-talking, going on and on about yourself without giving the other person a chance to balance the conversation, and not taking cues that someone has had enough.\\n\\n(2) Obsessing over people, uncontrolled infatuations.\\n\\n(3) Thinking you are in love with people you don\'t really know well and are not dating.\\n\\n*Now, everyone does some of these things now and then. The issue is doing these things with people when you are still just getting to know them.*\\n\\n**Pursue your personal interests.**\\n\\nJoin a writing workshop, take a language class, learn how to throw a pot, learn how to tap dance. If you have time be lonely, you likely have a lot of time on your hands, use it! Activities doing what you love are good for the soul, keep you busy and with a full life, and you will meet people with common interests this way. It also makes you way more interesting when you meet other new people.\\n\\n**Work with what ever social connections you already have.**\\n\\nDon\'t feel bad about always being the initiator with people. Most people are pretty self-centered and kind of glide through life reacting to stuff, rather than being \\"pro-active.\\" When your friends don\'t call you, it\'s not because they don\'t care, it\'s likely because they aren\'t thinking as far ahead as you are, and aren\'t thinking about that much other than themselves or maybe their immediate nuclear family. And don\'t look down on being the initiator, it\'s a great characteristic to have and develop. Initiators are why relationships last. \\n\\n**Get rid of toxic people in your life.**\\n\\nThis may seem counter-intuitive - how can having fewer people in your life help being lonely? But there are different kinds of loneliness. Loneliness isn\'t really the opposite of having company, it\'s the opposite of having enough meaningful human interactions. Having superficial and stressful interactions with people can exacerbate loneliness. \\n\\nI also find that these typically lonely behaviors tend to attract toxic people - narcissists, users, etc. \\n\\n**If you are in desperate need of emotional support, consider finding a therapist.**\\n\\nIf you are already in bad shape and don\'t have anyone (or enough people to depend on), you may not feel like you have the year or so it takes to make a new, emotionally healthy friend in the adult world. In this case, look into getting counseling or therapy. There are a lot of cheap options out there and this doesn\'t need to be a permanent solution. But it can really help you be patient and make good decisions when desperation might make you do otherwise.\\n\\n***TL;DR - Sometimes, loneliness makes us act in ways that make us come across like we would not be good friends, like we don\'t know how to do it. When you\'re going through a tough time, it\'s natural that anyone might not be the best type of friend, and it\'s fine to expect support and tolerance from your existing friends. But while you are trying to make new ones, try to show you can be a good friend.***\\n\\nEDIT: I had a \\"fake it \'til you make it\\" line in here that I think people were taking too literally.

The documentation is excellent, yet it\'s not the best and not the worst looking.\\n\\nRecently I have started a more serious project that I hope to turn into a startup in a little. For this, I didn\'t want to keep using Carbon as my UI framework/library, because it has limited functionality in the sense of how many components there are, support for dark mode, and really good looking components. Also, customizability is not thaaat great, though it can be done.\\n\\nSo I started looking around.\\n\\nI\'ve come across [NextUI](https://nextui.org/) first, and it looked freaking awesome. I was impressed by looks, truly native support for dark mode, typescript and so on and so forth. What then devastated me is its lack of proper compatibility with NextJS 13, and also that it\'s not really finished yet (as is declared on their website clearly.) and therefore not really ready for production. \\n\\nThe docs are somewhat limited, and there isn\'t a real fix for the currently still flashing dark mode (which is a big contra for me personally).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe next thing I found was [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and I even started building with it. The lack of a Layout component, and some other issues with the docs and it being a comparatively small project with slow support and the discord not being too active was not what really turned me off.   \\nChakraUI looks decent, but it\'s too unopinionated for my liking. I want to ship, not have to configure Buttons with 16 lines of props first.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI then wanted to settle with [Ant Design](https://ant.design), but after reading through the docs, the, admittedly shitty first setup documentation and a lot of random Chinese elements spread throughout, I decided to post my journey on here and ask you guys for recommendations on truly good looking, documented and opinionated UI frameworks.\\n\\nSidenote: I also heard of MaterialUI, and I haven\'t really read into it, but I dislike Material Design itself very much. I just hate the looks, but if there is some kind of \\"theme\\" or whatever that I could put on top of it, I would consider using it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: I\'m on the search for a well documented, opinionated UI framework for React, please leave me some recommendations, that would be greatly appreciated \\\\^\\\\^\\n\\nEdit: thanks for all the replies while I was sleeping :D, I think Imma spend the day deciding what I\u2019m gonna use then","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/14ot7sy/on_the_search_for_a_truly_good_ui_framework/","datetime":"2023-07-02 22:28:55 IST","votes":134,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Question"],"archived":false},{"title":"Thought you guys might appreciate this xD","author":"kiara2_2","url":"https://reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/14mv4cd/thought_you_guys_might_appreciate_this_xd/","subreddit":"TwoXIndia","body":"","media":"https://v.redd.it/gs78ucfie49b1","datetime":"2023-06-30 14:30:45 IST","votes":698,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Funny "],"archived":true},{"title":"I run an AI tools directory. Here are my top picks for AI-powered digital marketing tools (that aren\'t just wrappers for GPT)","author":"AI_Scout_Official","url":"https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/14jt3up/i_run_an_ai_tools_directory_here_are_my_top_picks/","subreddit":"ChatGPT","body":"Look around and you\'ll see hundreds of AI tools being pitched as social media, digital marketing, blogging tools, etc. However, most of them are simply web apps with a nice UI and preset prompt over Open AI API. Regardless, there\'s quite a few that have stood out to me in terms of AI tools that offer more functionality than content generation. Here\'s my top picks for digital marketing and why:\\n\\n**MarketMuse** \\\\- AI Content Optimization\\n\\nMarketMuse is a real game-changer when it comes to content strategy and optimization. As a digital marketer, I appreciate the way it uses AI to analyze my website and offer personalized, data-driven insights, making my content planning considerably faster and more efficient. It automates the laborious task of content audits, eliminating the subjectivity often associated with this process. Additionally, MarketMuse\'s competitive analysis tool, revealing gaps in competitor content, is particularly insightful. Its Content Briefs are an invaluable resource, providing a clear structure for topics to cover, questions to answer, and links to include, streamlining the content creation process. The AI features of MarketMuse offer a clear edge in optimizing my content strategy.\\n\\n**Plus AI for Google Slides** \\\\- Presentations for Sales Pitches, Webinars, and Conferences\\n\\nPlus AI stands out as it intertwines with my Google Slides workflow, rather than offering a final mediocre product like most slide deck generators. It helps co-create presentations with the \'sticky notes\' feature, which essentially gives prompts for improving and finalizing each slide. A standout feature is \'Snapshots\', enabling you to plug external data, for example, from different internal web apps into your presentations. I use Plus AI to craft the foundation for my slide deck and then go through each slide to incorporate the right snapshot. It\'s free and integrates smoothly with Google Slides and Docs.\\n\\n**GoCharlie** \\\\- AI Content Generation in Your Brand Voice + Content Repurposing\\n\\nHelps you churn out anything from blog posts, social media content to product descriptions. What stands out is its ability to learn and replicate your brand voice - it truly sounds like you. The \'content repurposing\' feature is a godsend for recycling well-performing content for different platforms based on websites, audio files, and videos, saving me a huge chunk of time. It doesn\'t hand you off-the-shelf content, it co-creates with you, giving you the autonomy to review, refine and personalise. It\'s also got a free trial, and as a user, it\'s been a worthwhile addition to my digital marketing toolkit.\\n\\n**AdCreative.ai** \\\\- AI-Powered Ad & Social Creatives \\n\\nHaving a tool like AdCreative.ai in my digital marketing arsenal is such a game-changer. It employs artificial intelligence to produce conversion-oriented ad and social media creatives in just seconds. Its capacity to generate both visually appealing and engaging creatives, while also incorporating optimized copy, enables me to enhance my advertising campaigns\' click-through and conversion rates significantly. A feature I find especially valuable is its machine learning model which learns from my past successful creatives and tailors future ones to be more personalized and efficient. The scalability is impressive too; whether I need a single creative or thousands in a month, it delivers seamlessly. The ease of use, effectiveness, and time-saving capabilities make this tool an absolute winner in my book.\\n\\n**BrandBastion** \\\\- AI-Driven Community Management\\n\\nAs a digital marketer, one tool I find incredibly beneficial is BrandBastion. It shines with its AI-driven approach to managing social media conversations around the clock, with impressive precision and speed. The AI here does a fantastic job at identifying harmful comments and hiding them, keeping brand reputation intact. What sets it apart is the balance it strikes between automation and human touch - the AI analyses conversations and alerts human content specialists for any sensitive issue, ensuring nothing gets overlooked. Additionally, the \\"BrandBastion Lite\\" platform serves as a centralized space to understand brand sentiment, moderate comments, and engage with followers, making it a breeze to manage all social media conversations in one place.\\n\\n**Contlo** \\\\- Autonomous Generative Marketing\\n\\nContlo stands out as a highly autonomous AI-powered marketing tool that significantly streamlines my marketing efforts. One of its prime strengths is the Generative AI Model that enables creation of contextually relevant marketing materials, including landing pages, emails, and social media creatives. Speaking with the AI through a chat interface simplifies my entire marketing process without having to grapple with a complex UI. I\'ve also found the generative marketing workflows to be particularly useful in creating custom audience segments and scheduling campaigns based on dynamic user behavior. Even more, its constant learning and self-improvement based on my usage make it a robust tool that evolves with my marketing needs.\\n\\n**GapScout** \\\\- AI-Driven Market Insights\\n\\nThe strategic force behind my business decisions is GapScout, a unique AI tool that leverages customer reviews for gaining market insights. Its distinguishing feature is the AI\'s ability to meticulously scan and analyze reviews about my company and competitors, revealing potential opportunities and highlighting gaps in the market. This level of scrutiny offers a goldmine of data-driven feedback, helping me improve offers, identify new revenue avenues, and refine sales copy to boost conversion rates. For an edge in the market, GapScout\'s competitor surveillance keeps me informed of their activities, saving precious time and effort. It\'s an invaluable tool, providing clear, actionable insights that fuel data-backed business growth.\\n\\n**Predis.ai** \\\\- AI Social Media Management\\n\\nAs a digital marketer, Predis.ai is my go-to tool for generating and managing social media content. The platform\'s AI capabilities are quite comprehensive; they\'re particularly useful for generating catchy ad copies and visually engaging social media posts, and for transforming product details from my e-commerce catalog into ready-to-post content. The tool\'s capability to convert blogs into captivating videos and carousel posts adds a fresh spin to the way I repurpose my content. Plus, it\'s a lifesaver when it comes to scheduling and publishing - it integrates seamlessly with multiple platforms and takes care of all posting duties in one place. Predis.ai essentially puts AI in the driving seat of my social media management and I couldn\'t be more pleased with the efficiency it offers.\\n\\n**QuantPlus** \\\\- AI Ad Creative Insights\\n\\nQuantPlus truly brings AI to the ad creation process in a novel way. Rather than just run multivariate tests, it deconstructs historical ad campaign data to analyze individual elements. Using this data, the tool ranks the performance of various elements such as CTA\'s, phrase combinations, imagery content, colors, keywords, and even gender distribution, among many others. It\'s like having a super-powered marketing analyst, giving me access to insights about top performing elements and aiding me in making more informed design decisions. This makes the ad creation process not just more efficient, but significantly more effective, as I\'m working off proven high-ranking creative elements. It\'s an indispensable part of my digital marketing toolkit.\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\n**P.S.** If you liked this, I\'ve created a [free directory](https://aiscout.net/) with over **1300 AI tools** listed for almost any use case.

The stats showed that OP has been regular on competitive coding platforms for ~400 odd days.\\n\\nI\'d mentioned something similar in a comment on that post as well, but in order to send this message to a broader audience a post would be better.\\n\\n1. Competitive coding is a sport. It is about solving a small problem with a team of 1. In professional life, that is NEVER going to be the case. Please stop mentioning it in your resum\xe9, keeping it to your LinkedIn is fine. \\n\\n2. Instead of wasting your entire time on coding platforms, participate in hackathons. They somewhat simulate real life scenarios where you have to solve a problem with your team and then explain your approach to a jury, which includes focussing on designing scalable code, which unfortunately hardly any fresher cares about. \\n\\n3. Read about best practices of your language, SOLID principles, latest updates in your language - added features (their pros and cons), and so on. Learn about design patterns (atleast the common ones), implement them. I can guarantee the freshers boasting about their leetcode prowess will crumble in writing the most basic of design pattern. \\n\\n4. Read about abstraction, scalability and code readability. You are going to work in a team, the code you write will be used and updated later. STOP WRITING SPAGHETTI CODE JUST TO PASS ALL TESTCASES. \\n\\n5. Open the classes of libraries used in your code. If you\'re a Java dev, i highly recommend reading them. They are written so beautifully with people who are crazy-level experts. Trying to copy how they write code (designing, implementing and commenting) is going to make you a far better developer. Writing such code is an art, not just engineering.\\n\\n6. Learn to comment your code properly.\\n\\n7. Learn about testing frameworks and code coverage. \\n\\nMy background: I\'m a 3YOE Java backend dev with good salary, graduated from a Tier-1 college. \\n\\nThis is what I\'ve learned so far. You\'re going to work in a team, it\'s time you learn a few skills that will help you with it. Hope this helps, good luck!\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you all for your comments. This is in no way a shitpost on competitive coding, it is the cornerstone of logic building. But in no way is it everything, there\'s a lot more to software engineering than leetcode. Do leetcode, just don\'t let it be everything you do.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/14fsfab/for_freshers_busy_being_code_monkeys_on_leetcode/","datetime":"2023-06-22 09:14:21 IST","votes":583,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Tips"],"archived":true},{"title":"Build your own .apk with your personal API key in 15 minutes online","author":"AllMFHH","url":"https://reddit.com/r/Infinity_For_Reddit/comments/14c2v5x/build_your_own_apk_with_your_personal_api_key_in/","subreddit":"Infinity_For_Reddit","body":"Thanks to [Oha\\\\_der\\\\_erste](https://www.reddit.com/r/Infinity_For_Reddit/comments/14aogdf/comment/jocx9oz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\'s help and ChatGPT (building app via CLI), I managed to create a Google Colab script where you input your own API token and it compiles an APK file with the token.\\n\\nMaybe you want to do this after 1st of July or now, your choice.\\n\\n1.

At that time I was in the university and I walked a lot and ate the lot. Everything was good and I was wondering how people could not care about their body.\\n\\nFast forward to now, am sitting at my home with a body size that doesn\'t let me fit into clothes I bough last year. Gained 15 Kgs since university and of course I do have THE pot belly.\\n\\nBut an important thing to note is that in between the 10 years there is once when I peaked physically and mentally; lost weight and gained muscle. This peak was during lock down when I had work from home. Now I don\'t have a work from home anymore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**If I sit back and analyze on what is happening with me, here is how my average day goes:**\\n\\nI wake up at 7:00am, I cook with my wife for an hour just for lunch. Take my bike to office and battle Bangalore traffic for an house to reach office at 9:30am.\\n\\nNow I work till lunch, eat lunch sit back at work. Leave work by 6:30pm, battle traffic for a hour and half and reach home by 8pm. Prep dinner until 9, eat till 10.\\n\\nNow if I am extra stressed, I simply order dinner to \\"feel better\\" after the long tiring day. And invariably after the exhaustion there comes dessert then and there.\\n\\nNow Spending time with wife and using phone goes till 11:30pm. If there are any other tasks like paying bills, paying insurance, works with banks, book tickets for travel, track and manage finances blah blah blah. All these happen till 12:30am.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSleep and repeat.\\n\\nThis is what basically happens with me. Is this just how it is in India?  I just wanted to share the same and wonder if anyone was in this cycle and found a way out of it.\\n\\nPeace","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/13plefh/i_think_i_have_one_of_the_answers_on_why_indians/","datetime":"2023-05-23 16:40:52 IST","votes":1411,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Rant / Vent"],"archived":false},{"title":"Suggest some good projects in MERN.

Leetcode.\\n\\nThat\'s the name of the game currently. If you can do Leetcode, you WILL get a top offer from a top company. Thats all there is to it.\\n\\n**Here is how to properly leetcode:**\\n\\nDO NOT attempt to solve any questions on your own (YET!). Yes, you heard me right. I know I sound crazy. But solving ANYTHING on your own is a complete and utter waste of time. Don\'t even spend 5 minutes on a problem. You do not have the base knowledge yet. You will simply be getting frustrated, and spinning your wheels.\\n\\nSo, what do you do? simple.\\n\\n1. Go to grokking the coding interview (no DONT buy it. Waste of money) and look at their list of patterns.\\n2. Pick one pattern, and go to leetcode. Search for problems with that pattern.\\n3. Go through each problem for the pattern, and go STRAIGHT to the solution. Do not even spend 1 second trying to solve the problem. WASTE OF TIME.\\n4. Understand the solution DEEPLY. Make notes. Google things you don\'t understand. Watch videos on youtube about the solution. Go to the discussion section on leetcode and see what others came up with. Play around with the solution, modify variables, etc. Basically... UNDERSTAND THE SOLUTION AS DEEPLY AS YOU CAN\\n5. Move on to the next problem, and repeat.\\n6. After you have done this for enough problems, you will feel a lightbulb going off in your head. Congrats, now you know how to solve this pattern!\\n7. Go back and pick a new pattern, and do the same thing.\\n\\nBecause you aren\'t wasting time spending hours on a problem, in just 1-3 weeks, you will have a deep understanding of all the major patterns and common solutions to these patterns. You will be able to recognize how to break down a problem into specific patterns, etc.\\n\\nOnce you have done 300-400 problems like this (it sounds like a lot, but remember.. you are NOT wasting hours per problem trying to solve it.. so you will go through A LOT of problems in a short amount of time.. the key is NOT to memorize, but to UNDERSTAND THE PATTERNS), you can start going through company specific questions on leetcode by buying premium. You will notice you can solve them now on your own!\\n\\nCongrats, you just saved yourself months and months of headache and frustration.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgktuv/the_definitive_way_on_how_to_leetcode_properly/","datetime":"2022-01-31 03:58:50 IST","votes":7125,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":false},{"title":"Which is the best coding language to learn from zero to get a job in minimum amount of time ?","author":"[deleted]","url":"https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/134ewzq/which_is_the_best_coding_language_to_learn_from/","subreddit":"developersIndia","body":"I am a BTech in non cs , graduated in 2019...","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/134ewzq/which_is_the_best_coding_language_to_learn_from/","datetime":"2023-05-01 12:14:47 IST","votes":72,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Help"],"archived":true},{"title":"ELI5 - how does mentalism work?

For the kind of headstart we had in the industry and the skilled workforce we have, we\'re doing pretty poor compared to the rest of the world. We hardly have any products to speak of that\'ve come out of India. Our open source contribution is scarce and scattered. We have no presence in discussions of technology at the global level. We don\'t get to [drive tech](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/india/2011-November/004998.html). \\n\\nWe\'re hurting the future of the industry in our country, and at the same time, making our lives less interesting and less fulfilling. It was refreshing to see people call out Zomato\'s shitty practices in that thread. It shows people care and what they really want. The problem is short-sighted, selfish businesses.\\n\\nThe most important thing we need right now is a healthy working environment. The best environment will attract the best people, who will in turn write the best software which will result in the best business. But we have decades of toxic practices bogging us down. We need to do all we can to encourage and foster new, modern ways of working. With that spirit, can we make a list of developer friendly companies to work for in India? But first, what makes a company developer friendly?\\n\\n**Developers are first class citizens**\\n\\nDevelopers are not relegated to the cogs of the machine. You don\'t just execute instructions trickled down to you by a chain of command, but are involved in all stages of decision making. You get to influence team organisation, timelines, business direction and company policy.\\n \\n**Freedom in work**\\n\\nA developer knows best the manner in which something needs to be implemented. This means using the libraries, tools and development practices of your choice. You own the code and how you manage the code is your business. If something needs to be refactored, it\'s your call. If there\'s a piece of generic code you want to publish open source, it\'s your call.\\n\\n**Meaningful working hours**\\n\\nBasing your business on hiring desperate grads and overworking them is not only a bad, bad business model but also exploitation. Besides, it\'s ~~illegal~~(Apparently, it\'s not illegal). Such practices are extremely short sighted and toxic to the health of the industry. They affect the lives of individuals directly and are [bad for the business](http://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/).\\n\\n**Casual office environment**\\n\\nNothing screams authority and submission like telling someone what they can wear. Dress codes are from a bygone era and make no sense especially for software development. It [affects](http://www.fastcompany.com/3018572/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/do-dress-codes-at-the-office-work) comfort, productivity, creativity and morale. A comfortable office environment must also take care of other needs, like food and beverages and recreation. These things must be accessible and not merely present as tokens.\\n\\nLet\'s make such companies visible and bring awareness to what they stand for so as to set a precedent of minimum expectations in our industry.\\n","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2yzab8/developers_of_india_what_are_some_developer/","datetime":"2015-03-14 07:50:14 IST","votes":78,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["[R]eddiquette"],"archived":false},{"title":"LPT: if you are in need of ideas, try going for a daily walk and staying present while you observe your surroundings","author":"adamwrites19","url":"https://reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/12i2l6k/lpt_if_you_are_in_need_of_ideas_try_going_for_a/","subreddit":"LifeProTips","body":"There is a surprising amount of ideas that seem to make their way in when taking in the everyday sights in your neighborhood or local area.

Do your job to the best of your ability because its what you are a professional. To be in upper management you have to know how to play politics, to be an engineer you have to actually understand your trade. Do your best so you can look yourself in the mirror and know your worth isn\'t what a bean counter says it is. Its about self-respect. and if you end up laid off or even PIPed, you can hold your head high. That confidence will move you to the front of the line for the interviews to come.\\n\\n2. Keep records of what you do. Once a month update your resume. Stand back and look at what you did in a way that will stand out when interviewing. Don\'t wait until after you are locked out - write it down now while you can review your own work.\\n\\n3. Listen to your teammates - are they allies or adversaries? Are their review comments helpful or building a case against you in the next ranking. Not everyone is your friend and not everyone is your enemy. Always treat both with respect, but don\'t be na\xefve. Quickly discovering who is on your side is the number one thing you can do to protect yourself when politics are played.\\n\\n4. Talk to your manager, regularly. Never assume they know what you are doing even if they are in stand up. Get yourself on their calendar at least every other week. Make your work visible to them, document it every week. If they like you, it will be used to defend you. If they hate you, they will let you know where you stand earlier.\\n\\n5. Be visible to your skip level and to other team leads This protects you if your manager isn\'t liked. I\'ve seen way too many great engineers suffer because of a manager that wasn\'t liked by their boss.\\n\\n6. Pay attention in all hands - not the pre-prepared, highly sanitized slides but listen careful for how they respond to questions. Management are employees too - they have been told what they cannot share but they will slip up. Micro-mistakes usually. Chat with a least one co-worker about what you heard, they will hear something different.\\n\\n7. Watch how your company (all companies actually) treats its employees in bad times - take note of the companies that violate their principles when things get hard. Watch which ones do rolling layoffs, forced URA, prefer hiring over promoting. Do they offer remote and then demand RTO? Take note of this - its indicates a company that doesn\'t respect you.\\n\\n8. Watch what the CEO does - does he play follow the leader? Is he afraid of making announcements? Does he hold all-hands and then announce a controversial policy the next day? Take note of this - these are weak leaders and forecasts more of the same in the future.\\n\\n9. Remember, if you are laid off - its never your fault. I know this seems like an obvious thing, but your mind goes there and will stay there. Layoffs are always mistakes made by upper management - they over hired, they tried to market something that wasn\'t selling, or they just want their stock options to go up. If you do #1, then don\'t blame yourself - you did your job. If you did 2-5 you did everything you could to protect yourself. If you did 6-8 you knew it was coming.\\n\\n10. Finally, and most importantly, make sure you spend time every day becoming better - do a LC problem, update your resume, spend 30 minutes learning something that will get your next job. Take the power back into your hands.\\n\\nIf this sounds like a \\"get over it\\" post - it isn\'t. I just spent 30 minutes typing it out because of Gobble\'s weak leadership. I\'m in the same boat, but I decided to think about the 10 things I could do. #11 is GTFO when I find something that makes me not worry as much. Respect matters more than a big paycheck.

She\'s my first gf so I was completely naive to think the same about her. (I mean I know she had a bf but nothing more than one guy)..\\n\\nThis is eating me up. I can\'t get the visuals from my head. The way she was with others guys and how she did stuff to them all is in my head.

What if my wife has hooked up with lots of different people and she hid it from me and one day I find out about it? I\'ll just go berserk.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIm new to all these relationships stuff.

If he\'s out of her life why the hell does she have the need to keep his photos and stuff?\\n\\nI saw her gallery by chance when she was showing me some pics and that\'s where I saw a complete album on his name.

I should\'ve dropped her sorry ass long back.\\n\\nAlso I can\'t get the images out of my head. The way they did stuff. It makes me puke.\\n\\nI really need to find a solution for all this.

(engineering team was 2 member including me)\\n* I have made little open-source contributions & write blogs on niche web tech topics.\\n* I had worked on 3 projects as a freelancer with international clients.\\n* My Tech stack -  React with Redux, Gatsby.js, AWS S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, AWS lambda, MongoDB, Postgres, Swagger YAML, can set up CI/CD pipelines, Firebase, Typescript, Express,  Next.js, Alexa.\\n\\n***Why I wanted a remote job with a foreign company?***\\n\\nMy CTC was less (I had a lot of equity). Most Indian companies weren\'t willing to offer above 6 LPA looking at my old CTC and the rest preferred IITians (and other elite college students). Preparing for FAANG & friends was not an option since I couldn\'t wait for 2-3 months to get an offer from them. Going with remote companies was the only option I had.\\n\\n***What do remote companies look at?***\\n\\n**For startups**\\n\\n* Previous startup experience.\\n* Your existing experience must match at least 75% of their current tech stack.\\n* You need to sound passionate enough during their HR rounds. It\'s a joke in India it is not a joke abroad, they take their HR rounds very seriously. A company I interviewed with had more HR than tech rounds. They are willing to hire a person who does well in HR rounds over a person who has done well in Tech rounds.\\n* Very Good speaking skills, your English should be good & you should be able to communicate with confidence.\\n\\n**For medium-sized organizations**\\n\\n* Your communication skills can be basic here.\\n* Tech stack can be 50% but you need to have more years of experience.\\n* You need to do really well in interviews. The process is longer here (takes 2 -3 weeks) with 5 rounds of interviews with assignments to do.\\n* You don\'t need to be passionate about the company\'s missions during the interview. Having tech skills will get you the job.\\n\\n**For both**\\n\\n* You must have remote working experience, if your company doesn\'t have that then get a freelancing job with a foreign client. This is a validation that you can work with different timezones\\n* Have a clean resume, don\'t overhype stuff. A lot of companies value the business value your work added, please add that. Try keeping stuff in 1 -2 pages & avoid having your headshot. Personally, I used Notion\'s resume format.\\n* Please use good git practices when submitting assignments & good folder structures. Use good practices like verbose variable names, following DRY.\\n* Please have little knowledge of DS & Algo, you won\'t be asked to write algorithms or implement them from your memory but you need to know when to use what. Also, practice a lot of geeks 4 geeks questions for your programming language (If Javascript, then Javascript questions in addition to DS/Algo)\\n* Please write a cover letter for every application. It should be specific for that JD. For example, if the JD looks like this -\\n\\n>Candidate must know:  \\n>  \\n>Kung-Fu  \\n>  \\n>React  \\n>  \\n>Haskell\\n\\nThen please write your cover letter as\\n\\n>Hi Team Company\\\\_name,  \\n>  \\n>I\'m Applicant\\\\_name, applying for Position\\\\_name. I have X years of experience and have 3 years of experience in Kung-Fu, React and have 1-year of experience in Haskell.  \\n>  \\n>Thank you for your time. Looking forward to hearing back from you.Best,Applicant\\\\_name\\n\\nA hack is to copy the JD and write the letter around those sentences.\\n\\n* Be inclusive in all your communications. It\'s 2021, avoid \\"Respected sir\\", \\"Respected sir/madam\\". Go with Hi, Hi Team, or any other way of referring someone without having to assume their gender.\\n* Learn TESTING. All kinds, unit, e2e, integration, automated. We Indian developers tend to ignore tests. Make tests great again. At least learn unit testing.\\n\\n***The questions I got***\\n\\n* Render a binary tree in React, with an option to collapse/expand nodes. Implement the best way to delete a node from the tree.\\n* Given an array, Print all prime numbers from that array in Javascript.\\n* Reverse a string in JS.\\n* A programming language has only three possible operations-\\n   * Initialize any variable to zero.\\n   * while condition loop.\\n   * increment any variable\\n\\nThese were the problem statements\\n1. Given b=5, create a variable \\"a\\" such that a=5\\n2. Given b=5, c =10, create a variable \\"a\\" such that a=50\\n3. Given b=5, create a variable \\"a\\" such that a=4\\n\\n* Create an event-emitter-listener in Node.js with support for the following\\n    * Implement a method \\"on\\" such that under a single event name, one or more functions can be registered & they all need to be called when the event is called. These functions need to be called every time the event is called.\\n    * Implement a method \\"once\\" such that under a single event name, one or more functions can be registered & they all need to be only called when the event is called once. The next time the functions should not be called (unless they registered again)\\n* Simple React debugging questions.\\n* How to optimize an API call that involves an expensive calculation that involves querying a database with multiple rows. The result fetched every time must reflect the latest value.\\n* Some questions on how TCP/UDP work. Differences between MongoDB & Postgres. Serverless vs monolithic. What is the repository pattern? How many virtual DOM does React have?  Why are web components good? Many other good questions I can\'t recollect.\\n* How to manage a team, how to design a codebase such that multiple developers can work on it.\\n\\n***The assignments I got***\\n\\n* For a famous tech blogging website. I needed to recreate a post\'s page using the API response JSON the front-end would receive.\\n* Needed to create a to-do full-stack application with support for sub-tasks, an option for marking tasks/subtasks as done, and some additional logic as well. (with at least 80% test coverage)\\n* Needed to create two functions with unit tests. One was finding the offices within the provided range from a list of locations. Another one was implementing deep-clone in JS.\\n* Some simple assignment about API calls with react-hooks.\\n\\n***Websites where I searched for jobs***\\n\\n* [stackoverflow.com/jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs)\\n* [RemoteOk.io](https://RemoteOk.io)\\n* [WorkAtAStartup.com](https://WorkAtAStartup.com)\\n* [angel.co](https://angel.co)\\n* [news.ycombinator.com/jobs](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs)\\n* [weworkremotely.com](https://weworkremotely.com/)\\n\\nIt is going to be a tough & long experience as it took me a month to get a decent offer. Don\'t send multiple low-quality applications to multiple vacancies, aim for good quality applications. In a month I had applied to more than 50 jobs. My application was accepted by around 10 companies.\\n\\nDon\'t work at Indian rates when working remotely. Your minimum should be what you would make if you were at FAANG & friends\' Indian branch.\\n\\n**Edit 1** - The companies that were interested in my profile are offering 35,000 - 60,000 USD per year. Most of them are well established medium - small organization.\\n\\n**Edit 2** - This doesn\'t apply to people who have no professional experience.

All of this works for a time, but requires consistent discipline and routine to actually do it\u2019s job.\\n\\nEventually the dry flaky behavior found its way to other parts of my skin - between my nose and cheeks, near my ears, by my eyebrows. Here too consistent moisturizer kept it at bay, but a missed day would mean a flair up.\\n\\nWhat I find is that not many people bring it up to their doctor - myself included. I would try many cocktails of fixes and browse the internet for a new method someone swore by. I eventually just came to the conclusion that maybe the climate is just too dry for my skin and I\u2019ve got to deal with it. \\n\\nHere\u2019s where a lot of ignorance in terms of dandruff comes in - dandruff is not due to the dryness of one\u2019s skin. The flaky nature of the stuff is quite the opposite. When your skin or hair is too oily, it attracts a normal fungus on your skin to have a feast and flair up. Throwing more oils at dandruff does not solve dandruff.\\n\\nAt the beginning of this year, I mentioned it to my doctor during my physical and he prescribed me a topical cream for my face, and a prescription shampoo for a few times a week. What I was diagnosed with was Seborrheic dermatitis - and it was in fact very treatable.\\n\\nSkeptical, I applied the cream without any lotion or moisturizer; not thinking it would do a thing. The shampoo as well after a shower.\\n\\nIt\u2019s gone. All of it. Completely gone. No flakes or problem areas anywhere overnight. It\u2019s so relieving to just have it gone. According to the PCP, it also doesn\u2019t require a refill - once it\u2019s done you\u2019re good to go.\\n\\nBasically tldr; talk to your Dr about bad dandruff and stop trying a concoction of remedies. It\u2019ll change your life.\\n\\nEDIT: woah this blew up. My prescription is as follows:\\n\\n- Topical Ketoconazole 2% cream\\n- Ketoconazole 2% shampoo\\n\\nEDIT 2: A lot of you have pointed out that Head and Shoulders and lots of other shampoos have Ketoconazole as the active ingredient. Unfortunately for whatever reason this did not work for me and I had to get a prescription. Though, I think this is why you should bring it up to your Dr. - if the treatment doesn\u2019t work then your Dr. can help you navigate what will work instead of you searching the internet and trying everything!","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/10hmg2r/ysk_you_should_tell_your_doctor_about_bad_dandruff/","datetime":"2023-01-21 13:53:17 IST","votes":21382,"nsfw":false,"flairs":[],"archived":true},{"title":"Once and for all, is it possible to get very high paid remote US/Europe based jobs from India?","author":"riderx65","url":"https://reddit.com/r/developersIndia/comments/yqgxgz/once_and_for_all_is_it_possible_to_get_very_high/","subreddit":"developersIndia","body":"Dozens of videos popping up on my feed these days which claim so.

My 2c as a senior","author":"awesomefossum","url":"https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zjofmk/what_makes_a_good_junior_engineer_my_2c_as_a/","subreddit":"cscareerquestions","body":"Something we see a lot in tech community forums are posts asking how to get into tech. This has been answered endlessly and will continue to be with varying degrees of snark depending on the mood of the people replying. Please, [read the friendly manual](https://roadmap.sh)! Something I personally haven\'t seen nearly as often, despite it being a much more interesting question, is \\"How do I succeed as a junior engineer?\\"\\n\\nMost people know and would agree that one\'s skillset can be broadly delineated into soft skills and technical chops. The interview process is (usually poorly) designed to determine whether the applicant satisfies each of those requirements. So, congrats! You\'ve landed your first job offer. What now?\\n\\nIn my opinion, soft skills are much more important to be effective as a junior than technical skills. They\'re also significantly more nebulous and harder to distill into something that you can just go study. They require huge amounts of practice to refine, and unlike tech, there\'s no test environment. Every interaction you have with another person is influencing their perception of you.\\n\\nI was recently enough a junior that a lot of this is still fresh, and I mentor juniors regularly at work, so I figured I\'d write this post up and recycle some content from a previous comment of mine that was well received in case this is helpful to anyone just starting out.\\n\\nHope some of this might be helpful to someone, and I\'d be super keen to hear from other folks in the comments if you disagree or have anything to add.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\n------\\n\\nWorry about your mindset first, you\'ll pick up the tech as you go. Keep in mind, everyone you work with closely will know that you\'re novice and should set their expectations accordingly. That is a huge blessing as it gives you a ton of room to blatantly not know things. A good junior should be curious, aware of their own limitations, and courageous enough to both try things on your own and ask for help when you need it.\\n\\nSome of this advice is tailored to my experience with organizations that were not practiced at onboarding and mentoring juniors, but a lot of it is generalizable.\\n\\nIn no particular order:\\n\\n- Ask questions when you don\'t understand something.\\n- Try to get a sense for when your question is specific to you being ignorant or whether it contributes to the discussion. If the former, don\'t interrupt a meeting to ask it. Ask someone on the side after (or during over chat, if you\'re comfortable with them).\\n- https://nohello.net/\\n- Learn to fish. People will generally resent being repeatedly asked to spoonfeed you information that can be looked up in internal docs or the internet. You wouldn\'t ask your senior colleague how to create a VM in Azure. You might ask their opinion on when to use a VM vs. a container.\\n- FIND WHERE THE DOCUMENTATION IS AND READ IT! If it\'s like most orgs, there will be several places to find docs and none of them will be up to date, but if the systems are still in use there will be good info in there even so.\\n- If you want serious brownie points, document a bunch of tribal knowledge that\'s missing from the new hire doc they give you. If there isn\'t a new hire doc, create one and list stuff you had to do to get onboarded. Permissions in this system or that, setting up MFA, whatever.\\n- Try to figure things out on your own before asking for help, but don\'t be stubborn about it. If you\'ve worked a minimum wage job, you\'ll be shocked by how much you\'re left alone in a professional setting. Don\'t misinterpret this as thinking you\'re expected to work by yourself all the time.\\n- Talk to your manager or some seniors on your team about a rule of thumb for how long you should spin your wheels trying to figure something out on your own before asking for help. I would and have been annoyed to find out someone spent 4 hours on something and didn\'t make any progress when I knew the answer already.\\n- Learn git if you haven\'t already. Not crazy stuff, but how to create a feature branch and open a PR at least.\\n- Try to understand (at a high level) the software development lifecycle at your company within the first few weeks. A good way to approach this is to pick a repository and map out how code goes from a developer\'s machine to production. Start with just system to system (dev machine -> github -> CI -> CD -> Develop -> UAT -> Staging -> Prod [or whatever it is]) then recursively dig into the actual processes happening in each system until you operate at the same abstraction layer as your senior colleagues.\\n- Volunteer for projects, especially things that other people don\'t want to do. The new pipeline ticket is toil for your senior colleague but represents a learning opportunity for you as well as a chance to deliver business value.\\n- Pay attention to things that seem silly. A fresh perspective on systems and processes that your predecessors have been working with for years can be invaluable.\\n- For the love of all that is holy, realize that people are smart and things are often the way they are for reasons that you have no knowledge of. Asking why is great, but reserve judgement on merit until you have a more comprehensive understanding of the thing you might be criticizing.\\n- Internalize the fact that many of the people you will be working with take a lot of pride in their work. While continuous improvement is an essential part of software development, be careful that you\'re not calling someone\'s baby ugly.\\n- Internalize the fact that as you level up your technical skills, your ability to drive impactful projects and make meaningful achievements is going to be hugely hampered or enabled by your colleague\'s opinion of you. Software development is a team sport and if you make people feel bad or are difficult to work with then you will be hamstrung in terms of your ability to get other people pulling in the same direction as you.\\n- Work with your supervisor (even ask senior colleagues for input) on a career development plan. You should orient yourself with the expectations of the next level up and use those to guide your progress.\\n- Do not abandon tasks unless priorities have shifted and you\'ve been instructed to pivot.\\n- Project management is almost entirely about setting expectations. Communicate early and often to stakeholders on if something is delayed or if you hit a roadblock!\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nSome great additions from /u/RationalPsycho42\\n\\n- Proactively seek negative feedback and take any negative feedback as help\\n- Keep track of everything you do. I found daily notes/to-do lists to be invaluable\\n\\nAnd a few more of my own have helped me advance\\n\\n- Keep a brag sheet of all your accomplishments that you can refer to during review time\\n- Be up front with your manager about your career aspirations and start the conversations early when you want a promotion or a raise. Something like \\"reviews are in 2 months, do you have any actionable feedback for me that I can work to address ahead of the review?\\" shows you\'re serious and hungry to continue to grow.","media":"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/zjofmk/what_makes_a_good_junior_engineer_my_2c_as_a/","datetime":"2022-12-12 10:56:08 IST","votes":882,"nsfw":false,"flairs":["Experienced"],"archived":false}],"comments":[{"post_title":"Scalp Psoriasis Peeling ","post_subreddit":"peeling","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/peeling/comments/1c7yw1a/scalp_psoriasis_peeling/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/peeling/comments/1c7yw1a/scalp_psoriasis_peeling/l0bsgqm/","comment_text":"in terms of scalp psoriasis. i just buzzed off my hair and moisturise scalp using epaderm cream.\\n\\nalso identify triggers and make diet and lifestyle changes.\\n\\nmine were meat, spicy food processed food and nightshades.\\n\\ni just eat chickpeas and mung beans and boiled veg and salads. \\n\\nlong term work out underlying cause of the psoriasis.\\n\\nthis [paper ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29908580/)and [podcast ](https://www.listennotes.com/fil/podcasts/positive-health/dr-haines-ely-md-is-QJ4TtfL_XBq/)helped me a lot.\\n\\ngood luck.","author":"SpecialDrama6865","datetime":"2024-04-19 22:58:23 IST","votes":15,"nsfw":false,"archived":false},{"post_title":"Noodles and Co.

You gonna fail miserably since you are short on time! What I did was reverse Engineering. That is, give a mock first and identify where you are naturally good at and can score, identify a section which has potential to maximise efforts and the other section where you are Mehhh.\\n\\nOut of your 100% of your time, maybe put 25% on your on your already good section to maximise as much as possible to go score the best. 50% in a section where you see huge potential (your basics are done, but lack of revision is causing. Needs lots of practise) and rest 25% into a section where you just need to cross your Sectional cutoff.\\n\\nFor you to get 95 percentile, you need score around net 54(18 Q. right - On average 6 questions in each sections). For 99 percentile 76 (26Q. - Average 9 questions in each section). To get these questions right in each question, you don\'t have to know all 22Q. of that section. Rather just the questions where you know stuff and make it right with accuracy.\\n\\nSo, try to ensure you grab those easy ones in each sections (Low hanging fruits), then aim at fruits you can get with a bit of jump which needs some push & efforts, and you also need to see at apples which are not within your reach and you need to skip (Topics which are extremely not familiar & difficult, you need to start from scratch and takes huge time & effort). Put your efforts in first two to maximise your score.\\n\\nDo not do topic wise each and everything. Give mocks and try to analyse in depth. Select your readings from the inputs you get!

I could go into a lot of detail but they key is to think about how to make yourself stand out at every stage during the interview process. To get past the resume screening, you want to make sure that your resume showcases the following things:\\n\\n* your pure CS skills. I have some personal projects that show that I have a good understanding of data structure and algorithms and can apply my CS knowledge.\\n* your software engineering skills. This includes your ability to work well in a team, communicate effectively, and pick up new technical skills quickly (different frameworks, languages, DevOps/IT skills). For example, I emphasized my open-source software contributions, and used FreeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorial to learn about REST APIs, front-end development, AWS, etc. I was then able to put these skills on my resume and this helped me get through the initial screening that HR does. Your consulting and finance background is valuable here - you just need to know how to frame it in terms of tech. \\n\\nNext comes the phone screening with the recruiter. This is where your soft skills start to become really important because the recruiter won\'t have a lot of technical knowledge, so you really have to impress them with your passion for software engineering, your interest in the company, and your future potential. Companies love to hear that you want to be with the company long-term and aspire to be a senior software engineer in a few years - entry-level software engineers are a huge time and money sunk for companies. They want to see that you\'ll be a valuable investment. \\n\\nAfter that is the code assessment/technical screening. You can find a lot of advice for those on this subreddit, but it boils down practicing a lot of Leetcode/Hackerrank easy-mediums and working through CTCI.\\n\\nLastly is final round interviews. If you\'ve made it this far, you\'re in pretty good shape to pass it. Make sure you can talk about yourself and all of the skill and projects you listed on your resume. Check GlassDoor to see what you should expect from this interview. COVID has made things easier in the sense that nobody\'s really doing whiteboarding interviews anymore - you get to use an online IDE for the technical portion. I used [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io) to prepare for the technical round with engineers. My final round interviews were pretty easy on the technical side of things; the focus was on making sure that the engineers and business folks on my team could see me fitting in with the team and that I could demonstrate my ability to learn technical skills.","author":"Odd_Vanilla_1329","datetime":"2020-12-22 05:35:48 IST","votes":125,"nsfw":false,"archived":false},{"post_title":"Thoughts on Marriage, Mumma\'s Boys and Daddy\'s Princesses","post_subreddit":"menslibIndia","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/menslibIndia/comments/ugv9zw/thoughts_on_marriage_mummas_boys_and_daddys/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/menslibIndia/comments/ugv9zw/thoughts_on_marriage_mummas_boys_and_daddys/i73m9cd/","comment_text":"This is so well written and brings out the intricacies of this discussion so well. Lovely post.\\n\\nI\'d like to soapbox for a moment here. Many times men try to draw parallels with how western women like the idea of a man who is connected with his mother and like that to justify their dependence on their mothers. One important factor that goes missing is that within those discussion those man are not being judges on how their mother is treating them, rather they are judged on how they are treating their mothers. Most of the time, in Indian families the bulk of the effort in this \\"close\\" mother-son relationship is carried by the mother. She coddles the individual while he sits back and enjoys rather than reciprocating even a iota of the effort. \\n\\nLet me punctuate this with an example of my own. My sister is right now 14 I am 21. For all of my life I have never made tea for my mother. For the last month or so my sister has been given the responsibility now to make tea for her. I was and still don\'t have any responsibility of that sort wrt to my mother and **especially** didn\'t in that age. I was expected to just sit back and mind my business while my mother worked her arse off and me obviously being a 14 y/o found that delightful. Yay, me! But now that my sister is of that same age she is handed this responsibility which she is expected to carry out with diligence every day at 6 pm. She has a twin brother who is also not given any responsibility, just as I wasn\'t. This is exactly the kind of sitting on your arse being served is the issue. We have to be very careful o whom to put the blame on here. At that age of 14, for both us, we were not to blame, the blame falls squarely on the disparity on the distribution of responsibility. But at this age, 21, if I still sit back knowing better and continue to be cream pastry then I am to blame for whatever shortcomings I might have later in life. \\n\\nWith that said, I have major issues with the word being used here. It is incredibly triggering because let\'s be honest the term Mumma\'s Boy is itself a patriarchal term. It is not a feminist term but has been repurposed in feminist circles to leverage a form of criticism. But we have to be aware that when we repurpose a term we carry its baggage as well.\\n\\nI have been called \\"Mumma\'s Boy\\" for quite often in my life. One important reason being that I liked to stick among women\'s circles. There is a kind of openness and vulnerability that I found appealing and often used to sit with my aunts and cousins and such. There was a post/comment over at 2xi where someone was commenting on how girls are thrust into the family dynamic much earlier in life as opposed to boys who are protected form the family politics of it all. Here is the the other side of the prism. That option to be thrust into hat dynamic also means that you get to accepted and have some sort of voice in that system. Within male circles in family a boy/man will be treated like he is 10 until he is married. There is no place for you there to be accepted and have a voice or even sit among them. You will be ridiculed for anything you say and don\'t you dare have an an ounce of vulnerability there. Its a cardinal sin. \\n\\nSo faced with this situation most men are given a choice. Either stay detached and alone or go to the women circles. The wider societal structure has conditioned most men to show displeasure at anything feminine, including their circles. This keeps them out of it. Hence we have so many detached Indian loners(Something I need to touch upon soon). The detachment comes baked into the system. And keep in mind when I am talking about Indian \\"Men\\" making a choice between the two (Women circle and detachment) I mean boys, this choice comes around the age of 14 when we start to develop a sense of autonomy. \\n\\n\\nNow, those of us who do gravitate to women circles are aberrant and need to be squashed. This is where the patriarchal usage of the term comes in. It has historically, as seen here too, been used to remove vulnerability from men. Having been brought up in an all boys school I had a deeper sense of vulnerability and openness (will write about how I think that\'s connected). I remember at the age of 16 I had a better sense of emotional expression than I do now. I remember being able to emote well and being more open about any issues I had. The years of being hounded with the chants of Mumma\'s boy in this case has left me as such that I am either neutral or angry in any public setting. It kills me inside that what used to have a healthy response within me now just erupts without my control. And these were criticisms of my emotional vulnerability used to be framed in the context of me being too much in women circles and being too close to my mother, often hanging out with her in the kitchen. And they were always made by my aunts or other women in these circles to get me out of there. Which it did.\\n\\nSo whenever these conversations crop up, boy do I have a hard time trying to engage with the conversation just because of the word. I hate the word. And that\'s its purpose. In a patriarchal structure the honour of the patriarch and prospective patriarch is important. That\'s why terms such as these are engineered purposely to seed a sense of humiliation. To present to them that they are too weak to be a prospective patriarch. The usage of humiliation to shape men is an explicitly patriarchal method because \\"OMG what could be WORSE than being humiliated. Be A MAN!!\\" \\n\\n\\nHell, the last time I was called a Mumma\'s boy, about 3 years ago, was because I went to my mother to have her apply the foundation on me because who else was I supposed to go to. But the other women there doing their makeup to were throwing that exact word at me for coming to my mother to get help with make up. And its pretty obvious why that term was chosen, \\"Men are not supposed to apply make up and those that do need to be humiliated.\\" I have not tried makeup since.","author":"thearcademole","datetime":"2022-05-03 06:20:47 IST","votes":22,"nsfw":false,"archived":true},{"post_title":"The Command:\u201ccd ../\u201d","post_subreddit":"ProgrammerHumor","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/uj17l9/the_commandcd/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/uj17l9/the_commandcd/i7g2goc/","comment_text":"Ctrl+r helps a lot","author":"pv0jewel","datetime":"2022-05-05 22:24:31 IST","votes":1493,"nsfw":false,"archived":true},{"post_title":"Completely free online resume maker that lets you export in JSON so you can edit on an external maker or re-upload later to make changes to an existing resume.","post_subreddit":"InternetIsBeautiful","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/urycfp/completely_free_online_resume_maker_that_lets_you/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/urycfp/completely_free_online_resume_maker_that_lets_you/i914r43/","comment_text":"[Flow CV](https://flowcv.io) is a good alternative","author":"Wherearemyquartz","datetime":"2022-05-18 08:45:55 IST","votes":278,"nsfw":false,"archived":false},{"post_title":"How do I get the most resume value out of my internship?","post_subreddit":"csMajors","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vjpfi9/how_do_i_get_the_most_resume_value_out_of_my/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/vjpfi9/how_do_i_get_the_most_resume_value_out_of_my/idl5j0a/","comment_text":"So resume writing is like 50-70% fluff/bullshit.\\n\\nFor example you say you are just fixing bugs and writing automation tests.\\n\\nYou can say something like: \\n\\n \\"resolve critical issues at scale for an enterprise system serving 1xx million customers\\".\\n\\n\\" Leveraged knowledge of test driven development to create robust automated tests to maintain strict quality standards\\".\\n\\n\\"Collaborate with end users/product owners/analysts/whomever to gather requirements and specifications for writing accurate and useful tests\\".\\n\\nI\'m not the best fluff master(hire someone) but at the very least this shows that you have experience working on \\"real\\" enterprise systems, have a grasp of testing and test automation and is someone that can work with others and take charge to get shit done.\\n\\nSprinkle in the technologies you are using or achievements or notable metrics and you have a decent little blurb on your resume.","author":"AdministrationWaste7","datetime":"2022-06-24 23:25:23 IST","votes":59,"nsfw":false,"archived":false},{"post_title":"meirl","post_subreddit":"meirl","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/vtv6vw/meirl/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/meirl/comments/vtv6vw/meirl/ifag5rj/","comment_text":"Check out [Wikipedia\'s List of Common Misconceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions) every so often","author":"graffitiworthreading","datetime":"2022-07-08 07:31:21 IST","votes":2382,"nsfw":false,"archived":false},{"post_title":"Men of Reddit, What are women not ready to hear?","post_subreddit":"AskReddit","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xaqfaz/men_of_reddit_what_are_women_not_ready_to_hear/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xaqfaz/men_of_reddit_what_are_women_not_ready_to_hear/invprg6/","comment_text":"I am not your ex; I am not your father.","author":"toes_of_frogs","datetime":"2022-09-10 23:08:36 IST","votes":14064,"nsfw":false,"archived":true},{"post_title":"Men of Reddit, What are women not ready to hear?","post_subreddit":"AskReddit","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xaqfaz/men_of_reddit_what_are_women_not_ready_to_hear/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/xaqfaz/men_of_reddit_what_are_women_not_ready_to_hear/inw8t5b/","comment_text":"\\"Why don\'t you evertalk about your feelings?\\" \\n\\n\\"Because when my feelings are opposed to yours, yours are more important/valid\\"","author":"[deleted]","datetime":"2022-09-11 01:15:08 IST","votes":5162,"nsfw":false,"archived":true},{"post_title":"The metabolism does not slow down in adulthood but does decline after 60 (research published in Science, 2021)","post_subreddit":"UnpopularFacts","post_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/xboc6j/the_metabolism_does_not_slow_down_in_adulthood/","comment_url":"https://reddit.com/r/UnpopularFacts/comments/xboc6j/the_metabolism_does_not_slow_down_in_adulthood/io10fv0/","comment_text":"What\'s your plan, what are you going to try?

The very simple version is: substances with a high osmolality will attract water, and lubricants with a high osmolality attract water straight out of your cells, especially the cells of your mucus membranes (found in the vagina, anus, and on the glans of uncircumcised penises). Lubes with too high an osmolality can cause damage and irritation to your body.\\n\\nA substance that attracts water to itself is called a humectant (if you\'re into skincare you have probably heard a lot about humectants). Sucrose is a humectant, but the two humectants you\'re most likely to find in lubricants are propylene glycol and glycerol (AKA glycerin). In general anything ending in \\"-ol\\" is likely to have at least some humectant properties, but not all humectants are the same and some are more problematic than others. The most important takeaway here is: **avoid lubricants with propylene glycol or glycerin.**\\n\\nOsmolality is not the only factor that goes into lubricant safety - pH and some types of preservative can be problematic as well.

That\'s a killer feature for quickly sharing text between your phone and your PC. Google Keyboard does not have it, ~~I wish they\'d at least add clipboard sync through Chrome, everybody has it open all the time anyway~~ - DOES NOW\\n* SwiftKey has \\"Bing hub\\", basically a browser inside the keyboard with a screenshot functionality too. Super convenient for quick searches of information and images without leaving the app. ~~I just wish it opened straight into \\"See more results\\" view instead of the initial horizontally scrolling results view~~ - DOES NOW.\\n* SwiftKey has Bing Chat. I don\'t know if it\'s ChatGPT powered, I would guess it is. It\'s useful sometimes\\n* ~~SwiftKey has an integration with Microsoft To Do, if you use it~~ - REMOVED.\\n* SwiftKey keyboard UI wise looks and feels better to me than Gboard. I like its look and overall layout a lot more than Gboard\'s\\n* Gboard has a [problem with resized keyboard](https://i.postimg.cc/wTBGn2YS/Sw-ift-Key-vs-Gboard-Normal-Resized.png) view. Letters get resized too and become too small\\n* ~~Gboard\'s voice dictation is much, much better than SwiftKey\'s.~~ SwiftKey has improved it on par with Gboard now\\n* SwiftKey\'s vibration/haptic feedback is better than GBoard\'s. ~~For example, the gesture to swipe left and delete multiple words on SwiftKey feels better. You get a tactile \\"bump\\" every time you go over a word and select it.~~ Gboard has it now too\\n* SwiftKey has arrow keys on the bottom. Very convenient. But also needs [cut, copy, paste and select all](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swiftkey/comments/13cs6lc/arrow_keys_bar_should_be_swipeable_to_reveal_cut/). You should be able to swipe horizontally between the arrow keys and cut, copy, paste, select all keys, if you\'re reading this, SwiftKey team\\n* GBoard\'s personal dictionary can be edited, imported/exported. Need to go to MS website to remove custom words from SwiftKey, and can\'t back them up\\n* GBoard\'s swipe prediction is good! Better than SwiftKey\'s in my experience\\n* ~~GBoard can copy-paste images.~~ SwiftKey can too now\\n* ~~GBoard has smart paste where it offers you pieces to paste from a large text you copied. SwiftKey Nintendon\'t!~~ It can now.\\n* GBoard has better shortcuts. Both have them, but with SwiftKey they are mixed in with the clipboard section for some reason, while with GBoard they\'re in a separate place. Shortcuts don\'t need to be in the clipboard section, you set them once and then use them \\n* GBoard has smarter text replacement. You can tap anywhere, at the end of the word, in the middle of the word and it will replace the whole word with the suggestion you pick. SwiftKey requires you to place the caret at the end of the word (but it automatically does it for you when you tap on the word), otherwise, if you place the caret in the middle it\'ll just insert the new word between the letters of the current one. Example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swiftkey/comments/15n8amq/can_we_steal_gboards_way_of_suggested_word/)\\n* Both have a different approach to text capitalization. I kinda prefer SwiftKey\'s because you just tap on the word and then tap the \\"Shift\\" key to cycle between different capitalizations, no selection required. But GBoard can change capitalization on multiple words at once, when you select them\\n* Both have nice shortcut toolbars above their keyboards with good shortcuts (Clipboard, gif/emoji/stickers, translate. SwiftKey also has Bing search, incognito mode and Gboard has text editing tools (arrows to move around the caret and select text/copy/paste - But SwiftKey already has arrow-keys-under-the-keyboard option, which is better placed). But I prefer SwiftKey\'s because you can hide if, even though you cannot [get rid of the (i) icon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swiftkey/comments/13esn53/could_we_get_an_option_to_replace_the_permanently/). SwiftKey\'s clipboard menu is also better laid out\\n* Both keyboards can be resized and moved around, including floating mode. I feel Swiftkey\'s is better though\\n* Both have themes\\n* Neither has \\"Undo\\" (only on swipe-back-on-backspace-to-delete)\\n* Both have hold-Space-key-to-move-caret-around - SwiftKey\'s goes vertically and horizontally though and it\'s logarithmic (movement speed varies depending on the speed of your gesture). GBoard\'s is only horizontal and it\'s constant speed. GBoard gives a haptic feedback letter by letter, SwiftKey doesn\'t.

NEVER, I REPEAT NEVER share your father\'s death certificate with anyone. If someone asks, tell them that you\'ll accompany them but do not send.\\n\\n6. If your family lives in a rented place, get the rent agreement remade into someone else\'s name from your family. \\n\\n7. Relatives ke samne kabhi bhi bank accounts, property, assets wagerah ki discussion mat karna. Naturally, after your father\'s death, you\'ll feel that it\'s just you and your family versus the world.

Nothing.\\n\\n\\nDO NOT DECLARE YOURSELF THE WINNER yet.\\n\\n\\nDo NOT tell anyone. The urge is going to be nearly irresistible. Resist it. Trust me.\\n\\n\\n/ 1.  IMMEDIATELY retain an attorney.\\n\\n Get a partner from a larger, NATIONAL firm. Don\'t let them pawn off junior partners or associates on you. They might try, all law firms might, but insist instead that your lead be a partner who has been with the firm for awhile. Do NOT use your local attorney. Yes, I mean your long-standing family attorney who did your mother\'s will. Do not use the guy who fought your dry-cleaner bill. Do not use the guy you have trusted your entire life because of his long and faithful service to your family. In fact, do not use any firm that has any connection to family or friends or community. TRUST me. This is bad. You want someone who has never heard of you, any of your friends, or any member of your family. Go the the closest big city and walk into one of the national firms asking for one of the \\"Trust and Estates\\" partners you have previously looked up on http://www.martindale.com from one of the largest 50 firms in the United States which has an office near you. You can look up attornies by practice area and firm on Martindale. \\n\\n\\n\\n/ 2. Decide to take the lump sum.\\n\\n Most lotteries pay a really pathetic rate for the annuity. It usually hovers around 4.5% annual return or less, depending. It doesn\'t take much to do better than this, and if you have the money already in cash, rather than leaving it in the hands of the state, you can pull from the capital whenever you like. If you take the annuity you won\'t have access to that cash. That could be good. It could be bad. It\'s probably bad unless you have a very addictive personality. If you need an allowance managed by the state, it is because you didn\'t listen to point #1 above.\\n\\n\\nWhy not let the state just handle it for you and give you your allowance?\\n\\n\\nMany state lotteries pay you your \\"allowence\\" (the annuity option) by buying U.S. treasury instruments and running the interest payments through their bureaucracy before sending it to you along with a hunk of the principal every month. You will not be beating inflation by much, if at all. There is no reason you couldn\'t do this yourself, if a low single-digit return is acceptable to you.\\n\\n\\nYou aren\'t going to get even remotely the amount of the actual jackpot. Take our old friend Mr. Whittaker. Using Whittaker is a good model both because of the reminder of his ignominious decline, and the fact that his winning ticket was one of the larger ones on record. If his situation looks less than stellar to you, you might have a better perspective on how \\"large\\" your winnings aren\'t. Whittaker\'s \\"jackpot\\" was $315 million. He selected the lump-sum cash up-front option, which knocked off $145 million (or 46% of the total) leaving him with $170 million. That was then subject to withholding for taxes of $56 million (33%) leaving him with $114 million.\\n\\n\\nIn general, you should expect to get about half of the original jackpot if you elect a lump sum (maybe better, it depends). After that, you should expect to lose around 33% of your already pruned figure to state and federal taxes. (Your mileage may vary, particularly if you live in a state with aggressive taxation schemes).\\n\\n\\n/ 3. Decide right now, how much you plan to give to family and friends. \\n\\nThis really shouldn\'t be more than 20% or so. Figure it out right now. Pick your number. Tell your lawyer. That\'s it. Don\'t change it. 20% of $114 million is $22.8 million. That leaves you with $91.2 million. DO NOT CONSULT WITH FAMILY when deciding how much to give to family. You are going to get advice that is badly tainted by conflict of interest, and if other family members find out that Aunt Flo was consulted and they weren\'t you will never hear the end of it. Neither will Aunt Flo. This might later form the basis for an allegation that Aunt Flo unduly influenced you and a lawsuit might magically appear on this basis. No, I\'m not kidding. I know of one circumstance (related to a business windfall, not a lottery) where the plaintiffs WON this case.\\n\\n\\nDo NOT give anyone cash. Ever. Period. Just don\'t. Do not buy them houses. Do not buy them cars. Tell your attorney that you want to provide for your family, and that you want to set up a series of trusts for them that will total 20% of your after tax winnings. Tell him you want the trust empowered to fund higher education, some help (not a total) purchase of their first home, some provision for weddings and the like, whatever. Do NOT put yourself in the position of handing out cash. Once you do, if you stop, you will be accused of being a heartless bastard (or bitch). Trust me. It won\'t go well.\\n\\n\\nIt will be easy to lose perspective. It is now the duty of your friends, family, relatives, hangers-on and their inner circle to skew your perspective, and they take this job quite seriously. Setting up a trust, a managed fund for your family that is in the double digit millions is AMAZINGLY generous. You need never have trouble sleeping because you didn\'t lend Uncle Jerry $20,000 in small denomination unmarked bills to start his chain of deep-fried peanut butter pancake restaurants. (\\"Deep\'n \'nutter Restaurants\\") Your attorney will have a number of good ideas how to parse this wealth out without turning your siblings/spouse/children/grandchildren/cousins/waitresses into the latest Paris Hilton.\\n\\n\\n^(Continued due to character Limit.)

Talk to her like a regular person, imagine that you\'re talking to a guy if that makes things easier for you. \\n\\nAs for the crippling fear of being thought of as a creep, let me tell you this. Guys who get called creeps usually do creepy things. If you ask someone out, they say no and you keep your behaviour normal (not hostile, not trying to overstep boundaries, backing off) then you\'ll NEVER be called a creep. And if a person calls you a creep just for asking them out for a coffee or lunch, then something\'s wrong with them. \\n\\n**What you can do is:**\\n\\n1. Practice being around women normally first. When your anxiety goes away and you\'re finally comfortable around women, then you\'ll feel much more confident in yourself. \\n\\n2. Asking them how they are or how their day is going and giving compliments is always a good way to start conversations. *ETA- If you are unsure about the compliments and don\'t want to come across as weird/creepy, then compliments about things they\'ve put an effort in are always nice, safe and can carry a conversation forward. For example, a good compliment + conversation starter can be \\"I love your sneakers/outfit/any accessory, very minimal/colourful/quirky/subtle yet eye catching/bold/what a great statement piece\\". A bad conversation starter is, \\"your eyes/smile is so pretty\\". Instead of that, maybe compliment her hair and ask her about her haircare routine.*\\n\\n3. Asking someone out doesn\'t always have to be \\"will you go out on a date with me?\\", you can always ask them if they want to have a coffee or lunch together till you get comfortable.\\n\\n4. I know it sounds harsh, but you\'ll have to face a few rejections to become more comfortable with it. The first one is going to hurt, the first few might be infuriating, but it\'ll take the fear away. Think about it; if interacting with women and asking one of them out is an exam, then you\'re not even putting yourself out there as of now. If you don\'t even apply for the exam, how will you ever clear it?\\n\\nAs long as you stay respectful and do not make others uncomfortable, you\'ll be perfectly alright. Hope this helps, good luck!\\n\\n*Edit for other commenters- Please stop with your disbelief and exasperation and don\'t make OP feel bad about it.
